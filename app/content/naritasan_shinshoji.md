### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: Fudo Myoo, Who Saved the Nation with Flames

Behind the grandeur of Shinshoji lies a dramatic history.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (Gohonzon): Fudo Myoo】**

The main deity here is **Fudo Myoo (不動明王)**. Although he has a fearsome expression, he is, in fact, a Buddha who guides sentient beings to the right path with a heart full of compassion.
With the sword in his right hand, he cuts away evil minds; with the rope in his left hand, he binds worldly desires; and with the flames on his back, he burns away all calamities. Therefore, he is believed to have excellent efficacy in **'warding off evil (yakuyoke)'**, **'fulfillment of wishes'**, and **'traffic safety'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Miracle that Quelled a Rebellion】**

The history of Shinshoji dates back to 940, during the Heian period. When the country was in turmoil due to the rebellion of Taira no Masakado, the high priest Kancho Daisojo, under the emperor's order, brought a statue of Fudo Myoo here and prayed earnestly for 21 days.
On the final day of the prayer, a miracle occurred as the rebellion was suppressed. Following a revelation from Fudo Myoo to "remain in this land and save the people," the temple was established. Its name became **'Shinshoji (新勝寺)'**, meaning **'Newly (新) Victorious (勝)'**.

### 2. 🔥 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Fire Ritual and the Great Pagoda of Peace

The spacious grounds are filled with sights to see. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Great Main Hall and the Goma Fire Ritual (護摩祈祷)**

The highlight of Shinshoji! The **'Goma fire ritual'** is held several times a day in the Great Main Hall. It is a ceremony where monks beat drums, chant sutras, and burn wooden sticks (gomagi) in a fire. Try the **'Ohikakari'** experience, where you lightly pass your bag or wallet over the fire. It is said that the power of Fudo Myoo will imbue them and ward off evil spirits. (Anyone can participate, free of charge)

#### **Somon and Niomon Gates**

The massive **Somon Gate** at the entrance and the red **Niomon Gate** boast an overwhelming presence. The giant red lantern (chōchin) inside the Niomon Gate was donated by merchants from the Tokyo fish market and is a symbol of this place. A must-have photo spot!

#### **Great Pagoda of Peace**

At 58 meters tall, the **'Great Pagoda of Peace'** at the highest point of the grounds is a landmark. On the first floor, you can experience shakyo (sutra copying). It's a great place to calm your mind.

#### **Shusse Inari Shrine**

On the hill to the left of the main hall is the **'Shusse Inari'** shrine. Dedicated to the fox deity, this spot is famous for praying for **'career advancement'** and **'business prosperity'**, just as its name suggests. If you're an office worker dreaming of a promotion, be sure to visit.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Imbued with the Power of Fudo Myoo

The talismans of Shinshoji exude a palpable strength.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive as many as six different types of goshuin here. The **'Fudo Myoo'** goshuin from the Great Main Hall is the most representative, leaving a strong impression with its powerful calligraphy and red seal. It's a prime destination for goshuin collectors.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Migawari (Substitute) Amulet**: A wooden amulet said to take on any misfortune that might befall you. It's good to carry for traffic safety or health.
- **Victory Amulet (Kachimamori)**: An amulet for victory, reflecting the temple's name "Shinsho" (new victory). Its sword-shaped design is impressive.
- **Zodiac Amulet**: Choose a protective amulet that corresponds to your zodiac sign.

### 4. 🍱 Nearby Attractions: A Street Filled with the Aroma of Grilled Eel

After your visit, enjoy the lively atmosphere of the Omotesando.

#### **1. Naritasan Omotesando (Eel Street)**

- **Features**: The 800-meter path from Narita Station to the temple is filled with the charm of the Edo period. The specialty here is undoubtedly **'eel (unagi)'**. You can watch the staff preparing and grilling the eel right in front of the shops.
- **Recommended Restaurant**: **'Kawatoyo (川豊)'** is a famous eel restaurant with a 100-year tradition. A good tip is to get a waiting number and then visit the temple! The unadon (eel over rice), crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, is the taste of a lifetime.

#### **2. Naritasan Park**

- **Location**: Behind the Great Main Hall.
- **Features**: A vast garden three times the size of the Tokyo Dome. It offers stunning views of plum and cherry blossoms in spring and colorful foliage in autumn. It's a perfect spot for a leisurely stroll to aid digestion after a meal.
