Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, we'll guide you to the first image that comes to mind when you think of Kyoto: the wave of red, the **'Fushimi Inari Taisha (伏見稲荷大社)'**. You've probably seen photos of the endless vermilion torii tunnel, haven't you? This is the head shrine of the 30,000 Inari shrines across Japan and is also ranked as the top destination in Japan by foreign tourists.

However, it's a mistake to think of this place as just a 'good spot for photos'. From the mystical legend of a swan landing 1,300 years ago and turning into rice stalks, to the massive Romon gate donated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi praying for his mother's recovery, this place is steeped in deep history and the powerful energy of **'business prosperity'**.

Shall we set off now to discover the steadfast protection of the fox god and the hidden stories behind the red torii?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Miracle of the Swan and the Rice Stalk

Each red pillar of Fushimi Inari holds 1,300 years of stories.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ukanomitama, the God of Abundance】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Ukanomitama-no-Okami**. 'Uka' means grain, or rice.
Originally a god of agriculture, as times changed, the deity evolved into the **'God of Business'** and the **'God of Wealth,'** supporting prosperity in all industries, including commerce and manufacturing. That's why it has become the most visited sacred site for Japanese entrepreneurs and merchants.
Thanks to the co-enshrined deities Sarutahiko (transportation) and Omiyanome (performing arts), it's also a great place to pray for **safety** and success in the **arts**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Rice Cake that Became a Swan and Flew Away】**

In 711, a wealthy man of this region, Hata no Irogu, committed an arrogant act of using a rice cake (mochi) as a target for archery practice. When shot, the rice cake transformed into a white swan and flew to Mount Inari, and where it landed, rice stalks (ine) grew (nari).
Regretting his actions, Irogu built a shrine there and enshrined the god of grains. This marked the beginning of the **'Inari (稲荷)'** shrine. Since then, it has grown into Kyoto's premier shrine, revered by the imperial court and samurai warriors.

### 2. 🦊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Red Torii Tunnel and the Wishing Stone

The shrine grounds are a vast sacred area covering the entire Mount Inari. Here are the key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Senbon Torii (A Thousand Torii Gates)**

The symbol of Fushimi Inari! The **'Senbon Torii,'** leading from behind the main hall, is actually a tunnel formed by nearly 10,000 torii gates. These gates were donated by people whose wishes came true, as a sign of gratitude. The light filtering through the densely packed pillars creates a dreamlike atmosphere. Capture the best photo of your life.

#### **Omokaru Ishi (Heavy-Light Stone)**

Past the Senbon Torii, you'll find the **'Okusha Hohaisho' (Inner Shrine Worship Hall)**. The famous attraction here is the **'Omokaru Ishi,'** a stone placed on top of a stone lantern.

1. Make a wish.
2. Lift the stone.
3. **If it feels lighter than you expected, your wish will come true!** If it feels heavier, it's a message from the gods that more effort is needed. Will your stone feel light?

#### **Mount Inari Pilgrimage (Oyama Meguri)**

If you have the stamina, try the 4km trail to the mountain summit. It takes about 2 hours, and the spectacular view of Kyoto city from the **'Yotsutsuji'** intersection will make the effort worthwhile.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Good Fortune from the Foxes

The souvenirs here are unique and cute, themed around 'foxes' and 'torii'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive three different types of Goshuin from various locations, including the main hall, the Okusha, and the mountain summit. The 'Tohai (登拝)' Goshuin, received after climbing to the summit, brings a special sense of accomplishment.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **White Fox Charm**: A doll or keychain of a white fox, the messenger of the gods. It is said to bring wealth and good luck.
- **Torii Ema**: Instead of the usual rectangular wooden plaque, this ema (wish plaque) is shaped like a red torii. Writing your wish and hanging it up makes you feel like you've become a part of the Senbon Torii.
- **Key Charm**: This charm, shaped like the key often seen in the fox's mouth, is said to open the door to having your wishes fulfilled.

### 4. 🍜 Nearby Attractions: Fox Udon and a Glass of Sake

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the tastes and styles of Kyoto.

#### **1. Food on the Approach (Sando)**

- **Features**: The food stalls and shops lining the long path from the shrine entrance will whet your appetite.
- **Recommended**: **'Inari Sushi'** (sushi rice in fried tofu pouches) and **'Kitsune Udon'** (udon with fried tofu) are a must-try! They originate from the legend that the fox god loves fried tofu (aburaage). The **'Tsujiura Senbei' (the origin of the fortune cookie)**, a crispy rice cracker with a fortune inside, is also fun.

#### **2. Tofuku-ji Temple**

- **Getting there**: 15-minute walk (or 1 train stop).
- **Features**: One of Kyoto's best spots for autumn foliage. The view from the Tsutenkyo Bridge, which spans a valley amidst magnificent wooden structures, is breathtaking.

#### **3. Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum**

- **Getting there**: 10 minutes by train (Chushojima Station).
- **Features**: Thanks to its pure water, Fushimi is home to many sake breweries. At the museum of the famous sake brand 'Gekkeikan,' you can see the brewing process and enjoy a tasting of aromatic sake.
