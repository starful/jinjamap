### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Oracle from an Old Man in a Dream

The beginning of Hakodate Hachimangu Shrine stems from a mystical dream.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Hachiman, the God of Victory】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Hondawake-no-mikoto (Emperor Ōjin)**. Since ancient times, he has been worshipped by warriors as the 'god of victory' and 'god of military fortune.' Today, he is known as the god of **certain victory (必勝)**, **passing exams**, and **business success**, helping people win in the competitions of life.
Thanks to the co-enshrined sea gods (Sumiyoshi) and god of abundance (Kotohira), the shrine is also highly revered for **maritime safety** and **bountiful fishing**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Guardian Deity of Hakodate】**

In 1445, an old man appeared in a dream to the local lord, Kono Masamichi, and delivered a revelation: "If you enshrine me in this place, it will prosper forever." The small shrine he built became the origin of Hakodate Hachimangu Shrine.
Since then, the city has faced numerous trials, including wars and fires, but the shrine has stood firm, becoming a spiritual pillar for its citizens. In 1880, it was moved to its current location in Yachigashira, becoming the true **'Sochinju of Hakodate (guardian deity of the entire city)'**.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Breathtaking View from the Hilltop

The view of the shrine that greets you after climbing the steep hill is moving in itself. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### The Haiden and Otori-zukuri Architecture

At the end of the approach, the magnificent Haiden (hall of worship) appears. Its unique **'Otori-zukuri'** style, with a sharply peaked roof, boasts a rare architectural beauty seldom seen even in Japan. Offer your prayers here with reverence, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' method.

#### Look Behind You! The Stunning View of Hakodate Bay

Once you reach the top of the stone steps, be sure to turn around. Beyond the straight-stretching path, you can see the city of Hakodate and the blue sea (Tsugaru Strait) in a single glance. It is the best viewpoint to experience the perspective of the deity watching over the city.

#### Power Spots: The Dream-Granting Water and the Old Pagoda Tree

- **Yumemi-no-mizu (Dream-Viewing Water)**: A mystical well tied to the shrine's founding legend. It is said that your dreams and goals will come true if you touch or drink this water.
- **Enju-no-ki (Japanese Pagoda Tree)**: This ancient sacred pagoda tree is believed to ward off evil spirits (魔) and promote longevity. Touch the tree and feel its powerful life force.

These are special shrine items infused with Hakodate's unique humor and wishes.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Ikasama Victory Amulet (いか様勝守)**: The mascot of this shrine! It's an amulet with a cute squid (ika) illustration. It's a play on words between 'ika' (squid) and 'ikasama' (by any means), carrying the powerful message of **"winning in any situation (by any means)."** It's extremely popular as a gift!

#### **1. Yachigashira Onsen**

- **Location**: Just below the shrine (5-minute walk).
- **Features**: A public hot spring loved by Hakodate citizens. The iron-rich, brown-colored water warms the body to the core. Soaking in the open-air bath while gazing at Mt. Hakodate is pure healing! (Remember to bring your own towel).
