### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A God of Learning and a Heartbreaking Love Story

When visiting a shrine, the first things to look into are the enshrined deities (神) and the stories behind the shrine. Tsuyunoten Shrine is a unique space where the god of learning and the spirits of lovers reside together.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): A Harmony of Academics and Relationships】**

While several deities are enshrined here, the most representative ones are as follows:

- **Sugawara no Michizane (菅原道真)**: The most famous **'god of learning'** in Japan. He died after being unjustly demoted, but was later deified in honor of his outstanding scholarship and character. He is the god who grants success in exams and academic achievement to students.
- **Sukunahikona-no-mikoto (少彦名命)**: The god of medicine, wisdom, and commerce, who helps with health and business prosperity.
- **Okuninushi-no-mikoto (大己貴大神)**: The greatest **'god of matchmaking (enmusubi)'** in Japanese mythology. He possesses a powerful ability to connect not only romantic partners but all kinds of good relationships.

#### **【Origin and History: Lovers Who Vanished Like Dew】**

The shrine's history dates back 1,300 years.
Originally, this area was a cape jutting out into the sea, and the name 'Tsuyunoten (露天)' originated from a poem by the god of learning, Sugawara no Michizane, who stopped here and lamented his situation as being "as fleeting as the dew (露)."

However, what made this shrine famous nationwide was an incident that occurred during the Edo period.
In 1703, a courtesan named **'Ohatsu (お初)'** and a shop clerk named **'Tokubei (徳兵衛)'** committed a double suicide in the forest of this shrine. Unjustly accused and unable to fulfill their love, the two took their own lives, vowing, "Let us be together in the next life, if not in this one."

This shocking true story was adapted into a puppet theater (Bunraku) play called **『Sonezaki Shinju (曽根崎心中)』** (The Love Suicides at Sonezaki) by the genius playwright of the time, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, and it became a massive hit. People began calling the shrine **'Ohatsu Tenjin'** after the play's heroine, Ohatsu, and the souls of the two who tried to protect their pure, albeit tragic, love were reborn as **'guardian deities of eternal love.'**

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Power Spot Filled with the Energy of Love

Once you pass through the torii gate and enter the shrine grounds, the hustle and bustle of the city fades away, replaced by a calm atmosphere. Hidden throughout the small but rich precincts are special places that grant wishes of love.

#### **Statue of Ohatsu and Tokubei**

The bronze statue located to the right of the worship hall is the symbol of this place. The figures of the two lovers, gazing at each other tenderly as they embark on their final journey, are vividly depicted. Many couples hold hands in front of this statue to pledge their eternal love or take photos to create memories. Next to it, there is also a cute face-in-hole photo board, which brings a moment of lightheartedness to the otherwise solemn atmosphere.

#### **Namba Shrine (難波神宮) Ruins and Main Hall**

Offer your prayers at the main hall, which has stood firm despite being destroyed by several fires and wars. Try praying with reverence following the 'nirei nihakushu ichirei (二礼二拍手一礼)' (two bows, two claps, one bow) etiquette. The area behind the main hall is said to be the former site of the Namba Shrine, adding to its historical depth.

#### **Hidden Power Spots: Water and Love**

- **Ema for Beauty Wishes**: Write your wish on a wooden plaque (ema) featuring the beautiful face of Ohatsu. It is said that this will not only enhance your outer appearance but also beautify your heart, attracting good relationships.
- **Water Fortune-Telling (水占) Mikuji**: The fortune-telling slips (omikuji) here are special. When you float the blank piece of paper on the sacred water within the grounds, letters will magically appear, revealing your fortune. Have your love fortune told through this mystical experience.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Items: Capturing a Token of Love

The finale of any shrine visit is, of course, the goshuin and omamori. Don't miss the unique and sentimental items exclusive to Ohatsu Tenjin.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here features the official name '露天神社 (Tsuyunoten Shrine)' written alongside the nickname **'お初天神 (Ohatsu Tenjin)'** in a friendly script. Sometimes, you might be able to receive a limited-edition goshuin with a scene from 『Sonezaki Shinju』, so collectors should be sure to check.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Enmusubi Omamori**: An amulet to help you find love. There are various beautiful designs, such as 'couple amulets' for partners to carry together or ones modeled after Ohatsu's gorgeous kimono pattern, making them great for gifts.
- **Sports Amulets**: Surprisingly, sports-related amulets are also popular. Amulets shaped like soccer balls or baseballs give strength to those praying for victory.
- **Mind and Beauty Amulet**: An amulet for those who wish to cultivate not only their outer appearance but also their inner self.
