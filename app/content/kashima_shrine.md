This is the head shrine of about 600 Kashima shrines nationwide and one of the most sacred sites, which, along with Ise Jingu and Katori Jingu, has been honored with the special title of "Jingu" (神宮) throughout its long history. This is **'Kashima Jingu (鹿島神宮)'**.

This is where the most powerful martial god (武神) of Japan's founding myths is enshrined, and it is a potent power spot for those facing important decisions or new beginnings in life. With its lush primeval forest, mystical deer, and a legendary stone said to prevent earthquakes, shall we journey together into the deep woods of Kashima Jingu, where 2,600 years of history have accumulated?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Martial God Who Pacified the Land with a Divine Sword

Before you stand before the grand torii gate of Kashima Jingu, let's first hear the magnificent story of the deity who resides here.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Takemikazuchi-no-Okami】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Takemikazuchi-no-Okami (武甕槌大神)**.
His name itself evokes the energy of 'martial arts (武)' and 'thunder (雷),' and he is the strongest god of swords (劍神) and war in Japanese mythology.
He is not simply a god who excels at fighting. He symbolizes the **'decisiveness'** and **'ability to execute'** that cut through life's hesitations and break through blocked paths. That is why warriors of old prayed here for certain victory before going to battle, and today, people facing important exams, business ventures, or life's turning points visit to gain the energy of **'victory luck (勝運)'** and **'new beginnings (Kashimadachi)'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Protagonist of the 'Transfer of the Land' (Kuniyuzuri)】**

The history of Kashima Jingu is intertwined with the 'Transfer of the Land' story, a highlight of Japan's founding myths.
The sun goddess Amaterasu dispatched the mightiest martial god, Takemikazuchi, to pacify the terrestrial world. Descending to earth, he plunged his sword upside down into the ground, sat upon its hilt, and commanded the terrestrial deities, achieving the great feat of peacefully receiving the land. He later aided the first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, on his eastern expedition by sending down his divine sword (Futsunomitama), saving him from a crisis.

To honor these achievements, the shrine is said to have been founded here in 660 BCE, the first year of Emperor Jimmu's reign. Kashima Jingu is a place where the 'god who laid the foundations of the nation' resides, having been present since the very beginning of Japan.

### 2. 🌲 Strolling the Precincts: Walking Through the Sacred Forest

The precincts of Kashima Jingu are a vast forest, equivalent to the size of 15 Tokyo Domes. This forest, home to over 600 species of plants, is designated as a Natural Monument, and simply walking through it allows you to feel an overwhelming life force.

#### **Otorii and Romon (Tower Gate)**

The pilgrimage begins by passing through the massive 'Otorii,' made from cedar trees felled in the forest. Following this is the brilliant red **'Romon' (楼門)**, a designated Important Cultural Property considered one of Japan's three great tower gates. You will be awed by its majesty as you step into the divine realm.

#### **Honden and Haiden: A Prayer for Decision**

The Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden), donated by the second Tokugawa shogun, Hidetada, exude a solemn yet splendid grace. Stand before the Haiden here, pay your respects with "two bows, two claps, one bow," let go of your inner hesitations, and steel your resolve. The energy of the martial god will surely straighten your spine.

#### **Okusando (Inner Path) and Shikaen (Deer Park)**

The **'Okusando,'** a path leading deep into the forest past the main hall, is the highlight of Kashima Jingu. As you walk under the sunlight filtering through the dense canopy of giant trees that seem to touch the sky (komorebi), you will understand with your whole body why this is called a sacred forest.
Along the way is the **'Shikaen,'** where the divine messengers, the deer, live. The deer of Nara are also said to have originated from here, as legend tells that the god of Kashima traveled there riding a white deer, making the deer here a special presence.

#### **Kaname-ishi (Keystone) and Mitarashi-ike (Purification Pond)**

At the end of the forest path, you can find the legendary **'Kaname-ishi,'** a stone said to be embedded deep in the earth, pinning down the head of a giant catfish that causes earthquakes. Though it appears small on the surface, its roots are said to be immeasurably deep. Pray here to find your center in life and remain unshaken.
Further down is the **'Mitarashi-ike,'** a pond where 400,000 liters of clear water spring forth daily. The transparent water and tranquil atmosphere will bring peace to your mind.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Carrying a Charm of Victory

Befitting a sacred site of a martial god, the amulets and souvenirs of Kashima Jingu carry strong and reassuring meanings.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kashima Jingu features powerful calligraphy and is stamped with **'常陸國一之宮 (Hitachi-no-kuni Ichinomiya)'**, showcasing its high status. During special festivals, limited-edition goshuin are also available, so don't miss out.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Katsumamori (Victory Charm)**: This charm, engraved with the character for 'victory' (勝), is a must-have for students, job seekers, and athletes. It grants the strength to win at life's crucial moments.
- **Kashimadachi Omamori**: 'Kashimadachi' means to set out on a journey or a new start. This charm opens the path and ensures safety for those embarking on new adventures like studying abroad, changing jobs, or moving.
- **Kaname-ishi Charm**: Like the stone that prevents earthquakes, this charm is said to ward off disasters and grant the power to protect what is precious.
