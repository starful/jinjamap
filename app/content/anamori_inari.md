Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' where we journey to special sacred sites around the world.

Today, we introduce a hidden gem of a shrine right next to Haneda Airport, the gateway to Tokyo's skies. Nestled in a spot overlooking the airport runways is **'Anamori Inari Shrine (穴守稲荷神社)'**. This place is a must-visit for travelers before their flights and a sacred spot for success secretly sought out by business people.

From the mystical tunnel of endless red torii gates to the legendary sand, **'Osuna,'** which is said to bring fortune just by taking it with you. Why not pray for the safety of your travels and your life at this place, which has created miracles alongside the history of the airport's construction? Let's begin right now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Warding Off Waves and Guarding the Skies

The deity here was originally a guardian who protected against the ocean waves. However, there's an interesting story of how, as times changed, it came to guard the skies as well.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Toyoukehime-no-Ookami】**

The main deity, **Toyoukehime**, is the goddess of abundant food, clothing, and shelter.
Originally prayed to for bountiful harvests, today she is known as an all-purpose problem-solver responsible for **business prosperity**, **increased financial luck**, and **household safety**. Among aviation industry workers and flight attendants, she is particularly famous as a reliable guardian deity for 'safe flights'.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of the Miraculous Torii Gate】**

During the Edo period, this area was reclaimed land. When the dikes collapsed due to rough waves, causing the villagers to suffer, a fox appeared in an old man's dream and said, "If you enshrine me, I will protect (守) the hole (穴)." Once a shrine was built, the waves miraculously calmed, and from then on, it was given the name **'Anamori' (protecting the hole)**.

There is also a miracle from modern history. After World War II, when the U.S. military tried to forcibly demolish the shrine for the expansion of Haneda Airport, a series of strange incidents occurred whenever they attempted to remove the massive **'O-torii' (grand gate)**; workers would get injured, or machinery would break down. In the end, the torii was left alone in the airport parking lot for over 50 years before being moved to its current location in 1999, becoming the symbol of the shrine. Thanks to this tenacious vitality, it became known as a place that bestows a strong fortune of 'never collapsing'.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Finding Fortune Beyond the Red Tunnel

It's filled with a quiet and mystical atmosphere that's hard to believe is so close to an airport.

#### **Senbon Torii: An Illusion of Red Light**

As you go deeper into the shrine, a tunnel of red torii gates, reminiscent of Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, appears. This path, called **'Senbon Torii'** (a thousand torii gates), was created by people who donated a gate in gratitude for their wishes being granted. Walking under the sunlight filtering through the densely packed red pillars feels like being drawn into a divine world. It's also a perfect spot for stunning photos.

#### **Okunomiya and the Mysterious Sand 'Osuna (御神砂)'**

At the end of the torii tunnel lies the highlight of this shrine, the **'Okunomiya'** (inner shrine). In a cave beneath its altar, there is an abundance of sacred sand called **'Osuna'**.

- **How to use**: Take some sand in one of the provided envelopes.
  - **At your entrance**: It wards off evil spirits and invites good fortune.
  - **Under your bed**: It helps to heal illnesses and protect your health.
  - **In front of a shop**: It attracts customers and ensures business prosperity.
- **Osuna-kaeshi**: When your wish is granted, it is customary to return double the amount of sand you took, mixed with sand from another place.

#### **Hissho Inari and Shusse Inari**

Within the grounds, there are also shrines for **Hissho Inari**, which brings 'victory,' and **Shusse Inari**, which helps with 'career success.' Those facing promotion exams or important contracts should definitely stop by to receive their positive energy.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Must-Have Items for Travelers

Befitting a shrine next to an airport, the souvenirs specializing in travel and safety are eye-catching.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin, with its design featuring a fox and a torii gate, is very beautiful. The limited-edition goshuin or goshuin-cho (stamp book) with an airplane illustration is particularly popular among travelers. If you're using Haneda Airport, be sure to get one as a memento.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Aviation Safety Amulet**: An amulet embroidered with an airplane. It's the perfect gift for those who travel abroad or go on frequent business trips. It's great for attaching to your suitcase.
- **Osuna Pouch**: An amulet with the sacred sand in a beautiful pouch, making it easy to carry. It wards off misfortune anytime, anywhere.
