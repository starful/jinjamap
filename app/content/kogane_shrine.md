### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the deity, or *Gosaishin* (御祭神), enshrined there. What gods are seated at the heart of Kogane Shrine, and what stories await us?

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

The primary deity enshrined at Kogane Shrine is the goddess **Nunoshihime-no-mikoto (渟熨斗姫命)**.

While her name may be unfamiliar to many, she is the daughter of Empress Hibasuhime-no-mikoto (日葉酢媛命), the consort of Japan's 11th Emperor Suinin (垂仁), and the wife of Inishikiirihiko-no-mikoto (五十瓊敷入彦命). Her husband and mother-in-law are also enshrined alongside her.

With these three deities enshrined together, Kogane Shrine is widely known for the following powerful blessings (*goriyaku*):

- **Increased financial luck and wealth building**: This is the most representative blessing, as indicated by the shrine's name and origin.
- **Business and commercial prosperity**: Derived from the story of the goddess who revitalized the local economy and industry.
- **Household peace and harmonious relationships**: It is believed that the family of deities enshrined together protects the harmony of the home.

#### **【Origins and History: The Benevolent Goddess Who Gave Away Gold】**

The history of Kogane Shrine is like a grand epic that traces back to Japan's mythological era. It began about 1,900 years ago, during the reign of the 13th Emperor Keikō (景行).

At that time, in this region, the Mino (美濃) Province, a powerful local clan known as 'Mutsunokami' was oppressing the people. In response, the emperor ordered his son, Inishikiirihiko-no-mikoto, to subdue them. The prince headed to the land of Mino with his wife, Nunoshihime-no-mikoto.

The prince eventually succeeded in defeating the enemy, but the long war had left the land of Mino utterly devastated. Farmland was ruined, and the people suffered from hunger and poverty. Although the war was won, the faces of the people were filled with sorrow.

Nunoshihime-no-mikoto, who watched this with a heavy heart, made a great decision. She decided to give away **all the personal property she had brought with her at marriage—her gold and treasures—without hesitation.**

She used this wealth to reclaim wastelands and improve waterways to encourage agriculture. She distributed food to the hungry. Her private fortune became a seed of hope for people mired in despair, allowing them to start new lives. Thanks to her devotion, the land of Mino gradually regained its vitality, and smiles returned to the faces of its people.

The people, who sincerely revered this merciful goddess who had saved them, decided to build a shrine on the site where she first settled to enshrine her. Based on the story that she used **'gold (金)'** to enrich the region, the shrine's name naturally became **'Kogane Shrine (金神社)'**.

Thus, the 'financial luck' of Kogane Shrine goes beyond fulfilling personal desires; it is rooted in the noble spirit of sharing, where 'my abundance leads to the community's abundance.' That is why prayers here carry a deeper meaning, and many executives and business owners are said to visit this place to pledge their social responsibility.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The grounds of Kogane Shrine hold a charm as deep as its history. Let's walk the path of worship and discover the places imbued with sacred energy, one by one.

#### **【The Giant Golden Torii (大鳥居)】**

Upon entering the shrine, the first thing that captures the eye is the massive, brilliant golden torii. The torii, which marks the boundary between the secular world and the divine realm, is painted in a vivid gold, starkly representing the identity of Kogane Shrine.

The moment you pass through this torii, glittering in the sunlight on a clear day, you'll have a special experience, as if your heart is being filled with the energy of wealth and abundance. This is also a prime photo spot, so be sure to take a commemorative picture before your formal worship.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

After passing through the torii and walking along the approach, the solemn yet serene Worship Hall (拝殿) comes into view. Here, you will offer your prayers according to the basic etiquette of Japanese shrine worship, **'nirei nihakushu ichirei (二礼二拍手一礼)'**.

1.  **Nirei (二礼)**: Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle.
2.  **Nihakushu (二拍手)**: Bring your hands together at chest height, slide your right hand down slightly, and clap twice. Then, bring your hands together again and make your wish with a sincere heart.
3.  **Ichirei (一礼)**: Finally, bow deeply once more to conclude the prayer.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Ebisu Shrine (恵比寿神社), a subordinate shrine**
  Next to the Worship Hall, there is a small Ebisu Shrine. Ebisu is one of the Seven Lucky Gods (七福神), the god of commerce and fishing. While the main deity of Kogane Shrine oversees the revival of industry as a whole, Ebisu Shrine is said to help with success in specific business activities. Be sure to pray at both for a synergistic effect.

- **The Sacred Ginkgo Tree (ご神木のイチョウ)**
  Within the grounds, a giant ginkgo tree stretching straight towards the sky is revered as a sacred tree (*goshimboku*). This tree, which has watched over the shrine for hundreds of years, is a symbol of vitality and prosperity. Especially in autumn, the entire tree turns a golden yellow, creating a magnificent spectacle as if proving the shrine's name 'Kogane (Gold)' with its entire being. Feel the tree's energy and pray for health and steady growth.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms (授与品): A Proof of Your Visit

After finishing your worship, it's time to take home the special energy of the shrine as a token of your visit. At Kogane Shrine, you can find unique goshuin and charms that captivate the hearts of visitors.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kogane Shrine are, fittingly for its reputation, very special.

  This is the ultimate specialty that makes Kogane Shrine unique. Available only on the last Friday of each month, or 'Premium Friday', this goshuin is truly a work of art. It's a clever idea linking the 'Kin' (金) from Friday (金曜日, Kinyōbi) with the 'Kin' (金) from the shrine's name, and it is lavishly created using **gold foil or gold ink**. The design changes slightly each time, so collectors from all over the country make a point of visiting on this specific day just to receive it.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

- **Financial Luck Amulet (金運御守)**: This is the most basic yet most popular amulet. It comes in a pouch lavishly embroidered with gold thread and is said to attract wealth and prevent unnecessary spending when carried.
- **Golden Egg Charm (金の御卵守)**: A unique charm in the shape of a small, round golden egg. It carries the wish that your talents and efforts will bear fruit and 'hatch' into great wealth. Its cute appearance makes it a popular gift.
- **Card-type Wealth Building Charm (資産形成お守り)**: Designed to fit modern lifestyles, this card-shaped charm slips perfectly into a wallet. You can keep it with your credit cards to always receive the blessings of financial luck.

### 6. ✨ Conclusion: A Memorable Worship Experience

Kogane Shrine (金神社) was not simply a place to pray for 'money.' It was a testament to the history of a goddess's noble devotion bringing prosperity to a community, and a sacred space that reminds us of the value of sharing and coexistence.

The reverence I felt upon passing through the golden torii and stepping onto the grounds, the awe of nature I felt under the centuries-old sacred tree, and the warmth in the story of Nunoshihime-no-mikoto will remain in my memory for a long time. A visit here teaches us that true 'abundance' is not just about filling our wallets, but about sharing with those around us and growing together. If you visit Gifu, I highly recommend stopping by Kogane Shrine to pray for your own kind of abundance.
