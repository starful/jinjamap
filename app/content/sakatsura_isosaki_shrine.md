Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

Just a short trip from Tokyo lies Ibaraki Prefecture. Here, facing the vast Pacific Ocean, is a serene sacred ground that seems untouched by the passage of time: **'Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine (酒列磯前神社)'**.

While the name may be unfamiliar, this place is a 'hidden gem' known to those in the know. It's not just because of the beautiful scenery overlooking the sea. It's because it holds a magnificent 1,200-year history deeply connected to Japan's creation myths, as well as powerful legends of healing illnesses and bringing immense financial fortune.

Today, we will embark on a pilgrimage to this sacred space, established in the land promised by the gods, passing through a mystical tree tunnel that seems inhabited by spirits. On this journey, we hope you will feel the breath of the gods who have protected this place for ages, and the earnest yet joyful wishes of the many people who dream of winning the lottery.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine has an extraordinary origin story. Once you understand the deep history of the shrine, even the sound of the wind within its grounds will feel special.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

Two great deities are enshrined at the heart of this shrine: **Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto (少彦名命)** and **Onamuchi-no-Mikoto (大己貴命)**. The combination of these two gods signifies a 'perfect blessing' for visitors.

- **Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto (少彦名命)**
  In Japanese mythology, this deity is depicted as having a very small stature, but his power and wisdom were greater than a giant's. He is primarily worshipped as the god of **medicine (医薬), sake brewing (酒造), knowledge, and commerce**. It is said that with his small body, he traveled throughout the country, healing the sick and spreading the art of sake brewing, thus enriching people's lives. As he governs 'health' and 'healing', which are most crucial for modern people, the shrine sees a constant flow of visitors praying for recovery from illness.

- **Onamuchi-no-Mikoto (大己貴命)**
  This deity is more familiar to us by the name 'Okuninushi-no-Kami (大国主神)'. He is also the main deity of the famous Izumo Taisha Shrine in Shimane Prefecture. He is the god of **nation-building (国造り), agriculture, and matchmaking (縁結び)**. His myth, in which he overcomes numerous trials to transform wastelands into fertile lands, provides powerful support to those seeking to overcome difficulties and achieve success in business or to build wealth by meeting a good partner.

Thus, Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine is a special sacred place that embraces the two most fundamental human desires: **'health of the body (Sukunahikona)'** and **'prosperity of life (Onamuchi)'**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Mysterious Light that Shone from the Sea】**

The story of the shrine's founding is like a fantastical film. According to records, it dates back to the night of December 29, 856 (the 3rd year of the Saikō era) during the early Heian period.

At that time, a mysterious, strange light appeared for several nights off the coast of 'Oarai' in this region. The light illuminated the entire sea as if it were daytime, and the villagers trembled with fear and awe. Then one day, two gods appeared in the dream of a man who was making salt in the village and delivered a revelation in a majestic voice:

> **"I am Onamuchi-no-Mikoto, and the one beside me is Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto. Long ago, we created this country and departed to the eastern sea, but now we have returned to save the people from their suffering."**

When the man awoke from his dream and rushed to the seashore, he found two strange rocks rising from the sea, just as the revelation had foretold. This mystical event was immediately reported to the imperial court, and Emperor Montoku (文徳天皇) considered it a sign of national good fortune.

The following year, in 857, a shrine was founded by imperial decree to enshrine the two gods. **'Oarai Isosaki Shrine (大洗磯前神社)'** was built where Onamuchi-no-Mikoto appeared, and here, **'Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine'**, was built where Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto appeared.

In other words, these two shrines are **'brother shrines (兄弟神社)'** and a **'pair (一対)'** that face each other across the sea. The old saying that the divine protection is only complete after visiting both shrines originates from this fact.

Later, during the Edo period, the shrine received special protection from the Tokugawa clan of the Mito Domain. In particular, the renowned lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni (徳川光圜), famous as 'Mito Kōmon (水戸黄門)', highly valued the shrine's historical significance and supported its extensive maintenance. With a history of 1,200 years, beginning with an imperial edict and continuing under the patronage of the shogunate, the deep passage of time is imbued in every tree and stone here.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The moment you step into the shrine grounds, the noise of daily life vanishes as if by magic, and a serene, sacred atmosphere envelops you. From the mystical approach that feels like entering another dimension to the breathtaking view of the sea, here are the must-see spots.

#### **■ The Approach (参道): A 'Green Tunnel' Embracing 300 Years of Time**

The symbol of Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine and its most beautiful scene is undoubtedly the approach leading to the main hall. This path, stretching for about 300 meters, is densely lined on both sides with giant camellia trees (Yab椿) and Machilus thunbergii trees (タブノキ), many of which are over 300 years old.

Over the long years, the tree branches have grown and intertwined overhead, obscuring the sky and naturally forming a **'mystical green tunnel'**. Once inside the tunnel, the forest is so deep that it remains dim even in broad daylight. The sight of sunlight filtering through the leaves (komorebi) and casting shadows on the ground is indescribably dreamlike.

- **Spring:** Fallen red camellia flowers carpet the ground like a red velvet rug.
- **Summer:** The deep green foliage provides a cool shade that offers respite from the heat.
- **Autumn/Winter:** In the cold air, you can feel the profound life force emanating from the trees.

Take a slow walk down this path, which is also designated as a natural monument of Ibaraki Prefecture. Simply passing through this tunnel, where only the sound of your footsteps and birdsong can be heard, will be a 'healing' experience that purifies the anxieties and worries in your heart.

#### **■ The Hall of Worship (拝殿) and Main Hall (本殿): The Space to Face the Gods**

At the end of the tree tunnel, where the light pours in, the majestic Hall of Worship (拝殿) greets visitors. Rather than elaborate coloring, the classical wooden structure, which highlights the natural color and grain of the wood, exudes a sense of history and solemnity.

Here, we pay our respects to the gods.

1.  Quietly place a coin into the **offering box (賽銭箱)**. (A 5-yen coin, which sounds like 'go-en' or fate/connection, is considered lucky.)
2.  Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle **(二礼, ni-rei)**.
3.  Clap your hands twice at chest level **(二拍手, ni-hakushu)**.
4.  Bring your hands together and pray earnestly for your deepest wishes.
5.  Finally, bow deeply once more at a 90-degree angle to conclude **(一礼, ichi-rei)**.

Behind the Hall of Worship lies the Main Hall (本殿), the innermost sanctuary where the deities reside. It is an important cultural property of Ibaraki Prefecture, preserving the architectural style of the mid-Edo period. Admire the intricate carvings and the elegant curves of the roof, and feel the power of faith that has been passed down for 1,200 years.

#### **■ The Ultimate Power Spot for Financial Luck: The 'Lucky Turtle Rock (幸運の亀さん)'**

Don't leave right after praying at the main hall. In fact, many visitors come here for a very specific reason. It's the **'Lucky Turtle Rock'**, located beside the Hall of Worship, on the path leading toward the coast.

This rock was originally one of the stones donated when the main hall was rebuilt during the Edo period. As workers cut and polished the stone, they were astonished to find that its surface revealed a pattern strikingly similar to a turtle's shell. In East Asia, the turtle is a sacred creature symbolizing longevity, good fortune, and **wealth**.

At some point, rumors began to spread that **"touching this turtle rock will make you win the lottery"** and **"it will improve your financial luck."** As testimonials from high-prize lottery winners followed, it became a nationally famous 'sacred spot for financial luck.'

- **Visitor's Tip:** Gently stroke the head and back of the turtle, which have become smooth and shiny from the touch of many hands, and make a specific financial wish. The area around the rock is filled with ema (votive plaques) expressing joy and gratitude for lottery wins, testifying to the rock's miraculous power.

#### **■ The Starting Point of the Myth: The Torii (鳥居) Gate with a View of the Pacific Ocean**

After receiving energy from the turtle rock, walk a little further toward the sea. You will find a white torii gate standing tall against the backdrop of the open Pacific Ocean.

This spot faces the direction from which the deity Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto is said to have descended from across the sea. The endless horizon and the sound of waves crashing against the cliffs below. This scenery, where magnificent nature and the sacred torii gate merge, is truly breathtaking. It's a view that makes you understand why the gods chose this particular land.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans (授与品)：Proof of Your Visit

Don't miss the chance to take the inspiration of your visit home with you through goshuin and omamori. Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine offers a variety of items imbued with its special prayers.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine is impressive for its powerful yet elegant calligraphy. In the center, the shrine's name, **'酒列磯前神社'**, is written in bold, flowing ink (墨書), and the shrine's red seal (朱印) is stamped clearly above it.

During special times, such as the New Year or the 'Camellia Festival,' the shrine may offer **limited-edition goshuin** that use gold ink or feature seasonal illustrations. These are very popular among collectors, so it's a good idea to check the official website or social media for information before your visit.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) and Engimono (縁起物)】**

Among the various omamori, the most popular are, of course, those related to 'financial luck' and 'health.'

1.  **Takarakuji Kigan Omamori (宝くじ祈願お守り)**
    As its name, 'Lottery Winning Prayer Amulet,' suggests, this is a must-have item for those dreaming of a windfall. This amulet is specially consecrated with the energy of the Lucky Turtle Rock, and many people keep it with their lottery tickets in a special envelope or their wallet.
2.  **Kaiun Kame Omamori (開運亀お守り)**
    This is a small charm in the shape of a cute golden turtle. It is said to bring not only financial luck but also to open up one's overall fortune. Its modest size and design make it easy to attach to a keychain or bag, and it's also a perfect souvenir.
3.  **Byōki Heiyu Omamori (病気平癒お守り)**
    This is a health amulet imbued with the divine virtue of Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto, the god of medicine. It is the best amulet to give as a gift with warm wishes for the recovery of oneself or a sick family member or friend.

After your visit to Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine, venture out to nearby attractions to experience more of Ibaraki's charms.

**1. Oarai Isosaki Shrine (大洗磯前神社)**

- **Why We Recommend It:** As mentioned earlier, this is the 'brother shrine' that forms a pair with Sakatsura Isosaki Shrine. Onamuchi-no-Mikoto is enshrined here, and it is said that one receives the full blessing only after visiting both shrines. The **'Kamiiso-no-Torii (神磯の鳥居)'**, built on a rock in the sea, is especially famous as a sunrise spot. The sight of the lone torii on the rock with waves crashing against it is overwhelmingly mystical.
- **Getting There:** About a 15-minute drive. (Visiting both shrines together is the classic itinerary.)

**2. Hitachi Seaside Park (国営ひたち海浜公園)**

- **Why We Recommend It:** This is one of Japan's premier flower destinations, offering a beautiful floral spectacle throughout the four seasons. In spring, the **Nemophila** flowers paint the entire hill a sky blue, while in autumn, the burning red **Kochia (summer cypress)** creates a fantastical landscape. It's perfectly accessible, just a 10-minute drive from the shrine.

**3. Nakaminato Fish Market (那珂湊おさかな市場)**

- **Why We Recommend It:** There's no better place to satisfy your hunger after a shrine visit. You can buy freshly caught seafood at reasonable prices, and the restaurants within the market serve delicious sushi and **Kaisendon (seafood rice bowl)** that fill your mouth with the aroma of the sea. Enjoy the vibrant energy of the bustling market.
