Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find the hidden gems of the city.

Harajuku is a place brimming with glamorous fashion and youthful energy. But did you know that right next to its bustling streets, there's a place that exudes a quiet, powerful energy, as if time has stood still? This is **'Togo Shrine (東郷神社)'**.

This shrine is dedicated to the legendary Japanese admiral **Heihachiro Togo**, who led Japan to victory in the Russo-Japanese War. He is revered here as the **'God of Victory'** and the **'God of Intellect.'** It's one of Tokyo's premier power spots, sought out by those facing life's crucial challenges, praying for certain victory.
From the precinct where the 'Z Flag,' a symbol of victory, flutters, to a beautiful garden that soothes the soul, let us guide you to Togo Shrine, where you can experience the surprising other side of Harajuku.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: How a War Hero Became the God of Victory

Behind the grandeur of Togo Shrine lies the story of a hero who defined an era.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Heihachiro Togo】**

The deity enshrined here is **Heihachiro Togo**.
He was the hero who saved Japan during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 by miraculously annihilating Russia's Baltic Fleet, then considered the world's strongest, in the Battle of Tsushima. His outstanding leadership and remarkable good fortune transformed him from a mere military man into a deified being who brings victory.
That is why this shrine has become a place to pray for all matters related to 'winning,' such as **victory in sports**, **passing exams**, **success in business**, and **overcoming illness**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of the Z Flag】**

On the day of the decisive battle, Admiral Togo hoisted the **'Z Flag'** on his flagship and delivered his famous address: "The fate of the Empire rests on this one battle. Let every man do his utmost."
As the last letter of the alphabet, Z symbolized a point of no return, the resolve for a final, decisive battle. The great victory achieved under this flag astounded the world, and the Z Flag became a symbol of triumph. After his death in 1934, this shrine was built here in Harajuku in response to the ardent wishes of the people.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Flag of Victory and a Healing Garden

As you step into the precincts, the noise of Harajuku fades away, replaced by a sacred and solemn atmosphere.

#### **The Path to the Shrine, Lined with Z Flags**

Throughout the shrine grounds, you can see the **'Z Flag,'** a pattern of intersecting yellow, blue, red, and black squares. As you watch the flags flutter, strengthen your own will to win.

#### **The Majestic Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden)**

Built in the 'Shinmei-zukuri' style, the same as Ise Grand Shrine, the main hall has a clean, unadorned, and dignified feel.

You will surely feel the powerful spirit of Admiral Togo.

#### **Senshintei (The Garden for Cleansing the Heart)**

Next to the main hall is a beautiful Japanese garden called **'Senshintei.'**錦鯉 (Nishikigoi) swim in the clear pond, and the seasonal flowers and trees create a picturesque scene. It is the perfect healing spot to clear your mind and find tranquility.

#### **Kaigunkan (Naval Archives)**

This is a small museum displaying Admiral Togo's personal belongings and materials related to the navy of that era. It's recommended for those who wish to see a tangible piece of history.
