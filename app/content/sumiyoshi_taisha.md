### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Gods of Purification Born from the Sea

Before crossing the red bridge of Sumiyoshi Taisha, let's first hear the stories of the gods enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Sumiyoshi Sanjin and Empress Jingū】**

This shrine is dedicated to the **'Sumiyoshi Sanjin (Sokotsutsu-no-o, Nakatsutsu-no-o, and Uwatsutsu-no-o).'**
According to myth, they were born when Izanagi-no-Mikoto bathed in the sea to cleanse himself of the impurities of the underworld. These deities, symbolizing the surface, middle, and depths of the sea, govern **maritime safety**, **protection from evil (purification)**, and **business prosperity**.
Additionally, the legendary heroine **Empress Jingū**, who successfully conquered the Three Kingdoms of Korea with the help of these gods, is also enshrined, filling the shrine with blessings for **safe childbirth** and **luck in victory**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Guardian Deity of the Nation Protecting the Sea】**

Founded in 211 AD by Empress Jingū under a divine oracle, Sumiyoshi Taisha is one of the oldest shrines in Japan. Since ancient Osaka was adjacent to the sea, it was a national sanctuary where people prayed for the safety of ships heading to the continent.
It was a place where envoys to Tang China would always stop to pray before their departure, and the hopes for courage to cross the sea and a safe return have accumulated here for 1,800 years.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Aesthetics of the Red Bridge and National Treasure Architecture

The grounds of Sumiyoshi Taisha are filled with a unique beauty. Here are the key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Sorihashi Bridge: The Rainbow Bridge to the Realm of the Gods**

Upon entering, the first thing that catches your eye is the red arch bridge, **'Sorihashi.'** Its reflection on the water's surface resembles a taiko (drum), earning it the nickname 'Taikobashi.' With a maximum incline of 48 degrees, it is challenging to climb, but it is said that simply crossing this bridge **"washes away the sins and impurities of the body and mind."** The view from the top of the bridge is absolutely spectacular!

#### **The Sumiyoshi-zukuri Main Sanctuaries, National Treasures**

After crossing the bridge, four main sanctuaries appear. The first, second, and third sanctuaries are arranged in a line, while the fourth is placed beside them. This unique layout is said to represent the formation of a fleet of ships sailing the sea. These buildings, constructed in the **'Sumiyoshi-zukuri'** style—the oldest style of shrine architecture in Japan—are all designated as **National Treasures**. Experience the essence of ancient architecture created by the harmony of red, white, and straight-lined roofs.

#### **Power Spots: Omokaruishi and Godairiki**

- **Omokaruishi (Heavy-Light Stone)**: Make a wish and lift the stone. If it feels lighter than expected, your wish will come true! If it feels heavy, it's a message from the gods that more effort is needed.
- **Finding the Godairiki (Five Great Powers) Stones**: In the gravel field inside the fence marked 'Godairiki (五大力),' find three pebbles inscribed with the characters **'五 (Go),' '大 (Dai),' and '力 (Riki).**' It is said that carrying these stones in a special amulet pouch (sold at the shrine office) will grant you five blessings: **intellectual strength, physical strength, fortune, financial strength, and longevity.** (The rule is that once your wish is granted, you should write the characters on stones you find nearby and return them, along with your original ones, in double!)

- **Nankun-sha's Cat (Maneki-neko)**: The 'Nankun-sha' shrine within the grounds is dedicated to the god of business. Its maneki-neko (beckoning cat) raises its **left paw (to attract people) in odd-numbered months and its right paw (to attract money) in even-numbered months**, making it fun to collect them each month. Collect 48 of them for the ultimate fulfillment of wishes!
