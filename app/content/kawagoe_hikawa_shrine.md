### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Steadfast Love Guarded by Family Gods

Why is Hikawa Shrine known as a sacred place for 'matchmaking' (enmusubi)? The secret lies in the special relationships of the deities enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Ultimate Avenger Family of Gods】**

This shrine is dedicated to five deities, all of whom are a **'family'**.

- **Married Couple**: Susanoo-no-Mikoto (husband) & Kushinadahime-no-Mikoto (wife)
- **Parents**: Yashimajinumi-no-Mikoto & Tenazuchi-no-Mikoto (Kushinadahime's parents)
- **Descendant**: Onamuchi-no-Mikoto (also known as Ōkuninushi, the god of relationships)

With the husband and wife, parents, and child all enshrined together, the shrine boasts some of the most powerful blessings in Japan for **marital harmony**, **family happiness**, and **matchmaking**. In particular, the dramatic love story of Susanoo defeating a monstrous serpent to win Kushinadahime's hand makes this place even more romantic.

#### **【Origins and History: The Breath of 1,500 Years】**

The shrine's history dates back 1,500 years to the Kofun period. As the head shrine (sōchinju) of the old Musashi Province (covering modern-day Tokyo and Saitama), it has been deeply revered by successive feudal lords. During the Edo period, the main hall was magnificently rebuilt under the patronage of the Tokugawa shogunate. The intricate carvings left by Edo's finest craftsmen at the time are still a source of admiration today. (Designated as a Saitama Prefectural Important Cultural Property).

### 2. 🎐 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Path of Heart-Fluttering Connections

The grounds of Hikawa Shrine are filled with a charming, whimsical atmosphere that seems to awaken your romantic cells just by walking through.

#### **One of Japan's Largest Wooden Torii Gates**

The massive, 15-meter-high vermilion torii gate standing tall at the shrine's entrance has an overwhelming presence. The calligraphy on the central plaque was written by none other than Katsu Kaishū, a hero from the late Edo period.

#### **Aitai Mikuji (Sea Bream Fortune Fishing)**

A famous feature here! The fortune slips (omikuji) are hidden inside sea bream-shaped figurines (tai). A tank is filled with swimming **red sea bream** for 'one year of an-tai (safety)' and **pink sea bream** for 'ai-tai (I want to meet you).' The fun of catching one yourself with a small fishing rod and their cuteness make for an unforgettable memory.

#### **Ema Tunnel (Tunnel of Wishes)**

Tens of thousands of ema (wooden wishing plaques) form a tunnel. Walking beneath the sunlight streaming through the gaps, seeing the earnest wishes for love and happiness written by others, will warm your heart. It's also the perfect spot for taking a once-in-a-lifetime photo.

#### **A Summer Tradition: Enmusubi Furin (Matchmaking Wind Chime Festival)**

From early July to early September, the shrine is decorated with over 2,000 Edo-style wind chimes (furin). Just like the belief that 'the wind carries one's wishes,' the clear, tinkling sounds and the myriad of colorful wind chimes create a fantastical atmosphere that perfects the romance of a summer night.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Miracle of 20 Per Day

Each of the amulets and items available at Hikawa Shrine is imbued with deep meaning and sincerity.

#### **【Enmusubi-dama (Matchmaking Gem)】**

**"Limited to 20 per day, distributed for free at 8 a.m."**
This is the most precious charm available here. Shrine maidens (miko) personally gather white gravel (sacred stones) from the front of the main hall, wrap them in a linen net, and tie them with a red string. A legend says that cherishing this stone will lead you to a good match, which is why a spectacular scene of people lining up from dawn unfolds here.
_A Romantic Epilogue_: If, thanks to this stone, you find your partner and get married, the two of you should return to the shrine to give the stone back. In return, the shrine will gift you a special 'Red Thread of Fate' amulet.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin (shrine seal stamp) at Hikawa Shrine changes with the seasons. Stamps featuring designs of cherry blossoms, wind chimes, or autumn leaves that capture the seasonal feeling will surely tempt you to start a collection.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Akai Enpitsu (Red Fate Pencil)**: This is a charm shaped like a short red pencil. It carries the meaning that as you sharpen and use it (as time passes), the distance between two people (represented by the cap and the pencil body) grows shorter.
- **Sakura Amulet**: A pink charm that carries a prayer for love to bloom fully, just like cherry blossoms.
