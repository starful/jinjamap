Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to the north of Kyoto, beyond the mystical delta where the Kamo and Takano rivers meet. This is the ancient sanctuary that has protected this land long before Kyoto became the capital 1,200 years ago: the UNESCO World Heritage site, **'Shimogamo Shrine (下鴨神社)'**.

This is more than just a shrine. It's a place where you can breathe the pure air of the primeval **'Tadasu no Mori'** forest, discover a mystical pond said to cure illnesses if you dip your feet in it, and find a one-of-a-kind amulet just for you.

From the healing and heart-fluttering matchmaking experienced while walking the forest path to the origin story of the sweet Mitarashi Dango, shall we journey together to Shimogamo Shrine, where the true charm of Kyoto resides?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Legend of the Red Arrow and Fateful Connections

Before you pass through the red torii gate of Shimogamo Shrine, let's first hear the romantic myth associated with this place.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of Connection and Guidance】**

Shimogamo Shrine enshrines deities in two main sanctuaries, the East and West Halls.

- **West Main Hall (Kamotaketsunumi-no-mikoto)**: The guardian deity of Kyoto and the incarnation of 'Yatagarasu' (the three-legged crow) who guided the first emperor when he was lost. He is known for providing exceptional blessings for **traffic safety, safe travels, and warding off evil**.
- **East Main Hall (Tamayorihime-no-mikoto)**: The daughter of the deity in the West Hall. She is the protagonist of a legend where she picked up a red arrow floating down the river, formed a bond with a god, and gave birth to a child. Thanks to this story, Shimogamo Shrine is known as a sacred place for **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'**, **'safe childbirth'**, and **'family safety'**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Guardian Deity of Kyoto】**

The history of Shimogamo Shrine dates back to before the common era. When the capital was moved to Kyoto during the Heian period, it was elevated to the status of a guardian shrine for the Imperial family and became the stage for the national festival, the 'Aoi Matsuri'.
In particular, the shrine's forest, 'Tadasu no Mori,' has been considered sacred since ancient times, and logging was prohibited. Thanks to this, the primeval forest has been preserved intact within the city.

### 2. 🌳 Strolling the Grounds: The Primeval Forest and the Healing Pond

The moment you step into the shrine grounds, you can feel a change in the air. Here are some healing spots you shouldn't miss.

#### **Tadasu no Mori (The Primeval Forest)**

This is a lush forest path that leads from the shrine entrance to the main hall. Giant trees over 600 years old form a tunnel, and the sound of the clear stream flowing is like ASMR. Just as its name 'Tadasu' (to ascertain the truth) suggests, walking here feels as if it washes away the falsehoods and worries from your heart.

#### **Aioi-sha (The Matchmaking Shrine) and the Conjoined Trees**

Next to the Romon (two-storied gate) is a small shrine called **'Aioi-sha,'** which enshrines the god of matchmaking. Beside it stands the mystical **'Renri no Sakaki,'** two trees that have grown together to become one.
It is said that you will meet a good match if you walk around this tree while making a wish. (Women circle counter-clockwise, men circle clockwise, three times!)

#### **Mitarashi Pond and Mitarashi-sha**

To the east of the main hall lies **'Mitarashi Pond,'** where clear water bubbles up from the ground. It is believed that dipping your feet in this pond during the 'Mitarashi Festival' in summer (July) will grant you a long and healthy life. Furthermore, the famous **'Mitarashi Dango'** was created in the image of the bubbles rising from the bottom of this pond.

#### **Kawai Shrine (The Sanctuary of Beauty)**

Located at the entrance of the forest path, **'Kawai Shrine'** is immensely popular among women. It enshrines Japan's foremost goddess of beauty, 'Tamayorihime.' Here, you can have a unique experience of praying for beauty by applying your own makeup to a hand-mirror-shaped ema (votive tablet).

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Goods: A One-of-a-Kind Amulet

The items available at Shimogamo Shrine are famous for their beauty.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive not only the Goshuin from the main hall of Shimogamo Shrine but also separate ones from Aioi-sha (for relationships) and Kawai Shrine (for beauty).

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Hime-mamori (Amulet for Women)**: The signature item here! It is an amulet made from beautiful chirimen (traditional Japanese crepe) fabric. Depending on where the fabric is cut, **no two patterns are exactly alike.** It's great fun to choose an amulet that feels like your own destiny.
- **Hiko-mamori (Amulet for Men)**: A simple and stylish amulet made from denim fabric.
- **Mizu-mamori (Water Amulet)**: This amulet contains sacred water from the Mitarashi Pond and is for prayers of health and purification.
