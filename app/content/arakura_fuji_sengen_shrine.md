Not far from Tokyo, in Yamanashi Prefecture, stands a sacred site facing the magnificent Mt. Fuji. The breathtaking view of Mt. Fuji beyond the vermilion five-storied pagoda is an image that represents Japan to the world. This is the **'Arakura Fuji Sengen Shrine (新倉富士浅間神社)'**.

However, this place holds stories too deep and an aura too sacred to be remembered merely as a 'photo spot.' From the legend of Yamato Takeru's prayers 1,300 years ago, to the victory wishes of Sengoku period warlords, and modern-day prayers for peace. Follow the breath of history and myth engraved on each of the 398 steps, as we embark on a special pilgrimage.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

The main deity here is the goddess of Mt. Fuji, **Konohanasakuya-hime-no-mikoto (木花咲耶姫命)**.
Considered the most beautiful goddess in Japanese mythology, she possesses both the radiant beauty of cherry blossoms in full bloom and the mighty power to quell volcanic fury. Thanks to the myth of her safely giving birth in flames, she is deeply revered as the goddess of **safe childbirth (安産), child-rearing, and fire prevention (火防)**.

Additionally, her father, the mountain god **Ōyamatsumi-no-kami**, and her husband, **Ninigi-no-mikoto**, are also enshrined, making this a place that bestows a wide range of blessings, including household peace, national security, and industrial prosperity.

#### **【Origins and History: Beginning with a Hero's Prayer】**

The shrine's history dates back to 705 AD. The legendary hero **Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto**, during his eastern expedition, climbed Mt. Arakura and was struck by the majestic sight of Mt. Fuji. He prayed to the spirit of Mt. Fuji for victory and peace, and the shrine was founded where he built a sanctuary.

Later, during the Sengoku period, it is said that Takeda Nobutora, the father of the 'Tiger of Kai,' **Takeda Shingen**, prayed for victory here and dedicated a sword, leading to a great triumph. This cemented its reputation as a sacred place for good fortune in war.

The red five-storied pagoda, the **'Chureito Pagoda (忠霊塔),'** which is now the symbol of the shrine, was built in 1963 through citizens' donations to console the spirits of the war dead and pray for peace. Here, ancient myths, medieval tales of valor, and modern prayers for peace coexist, making it a timeless place of prayer.

### 2. A Walk Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Hall of Worship (Haiden)】**

The Haiden, located in the center of the grounds, is a simple yet elegant wooden structure. Purify your mind and make a wish here, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette of worship. The intricate wood carvings on the Honden reflect the long-standing devotion to the deities.

#### **【The 398 Stone Steps 'Sakuya-hime Steps' and the Chureito Pagoda】**

The 398 steep steps leading from the parking lot to the Chureito Pagoda are called the 'Sakuya-hime Steps.' It's a nickname derived from the numbers (3-9-8) which sound similar to the goddess's name. As you get breathless, a look back reveals Mt. Fuji peeking through the tree branches, offering a comforting view.
At the top of the stairs, the vibrant vermilion Chureito Pagoda appears. Standing on the observation deck behind the pagoda, an indescribably beautiful panorama unfolds, featuring Mt. Fuji, the Chureito Pagoda, and cherry blossoms (or autumn leaves).

#### **【Hidden Power Spots】**

- **Kosodate-no-Shinboku (Sacred Child-Rearing Tree)**: A massive cedar tree next to the main hall. A small tree growing from its base resembles a mother holding a child, attracting a constant stream of parents praying for their children's health and growth.
- **Arai-no-Omizu (The Healing Spring)**: A clear spring where snowmelt from Mt. Fuji bubbles up. It is believed to have the power to purify the mind and body and heal illnesses.
