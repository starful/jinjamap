Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to profound sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Nogizaka (乃木坂), one of Tokyo's most sophisticated districts. Nestled in a quiet forest next to the glamorous Roppongi is **'Nogi Shrine (乃木神社)'**.
This shrine is dedicated to the national hero of Japan, General Nogi Maresuke, and his wife, Shizuko. It holds the tragic yet sublime story of the couple who ended their lives together, following Emperor Meiji in death.

Thanks to this story, it is cherished as a sacred place for couples praying for **'marital harmony'** and **'eternal love.'** It is also famous for its beautiful amulets modeled after traditional Japanese wedding attire. Shall we journey to Nogi Shrine, where the weight of history and the romance of love coexist?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Marital Bond Unbroken Even by Death

The story of Nogi Shrine is more dramatic than a drama.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Nogi Couple】**

The deities here are the historical figures, **General Nogi Maresuke** and his wife, **Lady Nogi Shizuko**.
General Nogi, a hero of the Russo-Japanese War and an educator, is a symbol of 'loyalty' and 'sincerity'. His wife Shizuko, who supported him as a devoted wife, is a symbol of 'a good wife and wise mother' and 'love'.
As they are enshrined together, the shrine is believed to have exceptional blessings for **marital bliss**, **family harmony**, and **matchmaking**. Furthermore, inheriting General Nogi's spirit of excellence in both literary and military arts, it is also a place to pray for **academic achievement** and **success in competitions (victory)**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Ultimate Act of Loyalty】**

On September 13, 1912, the day of Emperor Meiji's funeral, General Nogi and his wife quietly chose to take their own lives at their residence. It was an act of 'junshi (殉死),' following one's lord into death.
This shocking and sublime event shook Japanese society at the time, and countless people visited the couple's home to mourn. To honor their noble spirit, the shrine was built in 1923 next to the residence where the couple lived.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Forest of History in the City

The precincts are not large, but every step is steeped in deep history. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Old Nogi Residence and Stables**

Right next to the shrine, the **'Old Nogi Residence'**, where the couple lived until their final moments, is preserved. The simple and frugal wooden building reflects General Nogi's character. The red-brick **stables** have a modern atmosphere and are a popular spot for photos. (The interior of the residence is open to the public only twice a year, on September 12th and 13th.)

#### **Main Hall and Sazare-ishi**

Reflect on the couple's love as you offer your prayers at the solemn main hall. Within the precincts, you will also find the **'Sazare-ishi (pebble rock)'**, mentioned in the Japanese national anthem. It is a symbol of the wish for two hearts to unite as one, just as small pebbles grow into a great boulder.

#### **Shoin Shrine (God of Learning)**

Within the grounds, there is also a small shrine dedicated to Yoshida Shoin, a teacher whom General Nogi respected. It is frequently visited by students praying for academic success.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Items: The World's Most Beautiful Amulets

The items from Nogi Shrine are the perfect gifts for engaged couples or lovers.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Nogi Shrine is neat and elegant. On the monthly memorial day (the 13th of each month) or the day of the grand festival (in September), you can receive a limited-edition goshuin.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yorisoi Mamori (Couple's Amulet)**: The shrine's signature item! It's a pair of amulets designed as a bride in a **'shiromuku'** and a groom in a **'hakama'**, traditional Japanese wedding attire. Meaning 'to lean on each other (yorisoi) and be together for life,' it is incredibly popular as a wedding gift or a prop for wedding photos.
- **Tsuresoi Mamori**: An amulet for couples who have been married for a long time. It signifies a blessing for the 'years spent together unchangingly (tsuresoi),' making it a great gift for parents.
- **Victory Amulet (Kachimamori)**: An amulet to pray for victory, imbued with the spirit of the general.
