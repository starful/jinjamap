Hello, readers! This is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to Munakata, a land rich in history on the northern coast of Fukuoka Prefecture, facing the Genkai Sea. Here lies **'Munakata Taisha (宗像大社)'**, one of the oldest shrines in Japan and a designated UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site.

This shrine is the headquarters of traffic safety in Japan, visited by countless people each year to pray for the safety of their vehicles. But even more astonishing is its role as the **'Shosoin of the Sea,'** having protected the sea routes to the continent since ancient times. It's a place where 80,000 national treasures unearthed from the forbidden island of 'Okinoshima' and the legends of three mystical goddesses come to life.

If you wish to open a new path in your life, why not embark on a pilgrimage to Munakata Taisha with me now?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Three Sister Goddesses Who Protect the Sea

The mystique of Munakata Taisha begins with the story of three goddesses who protect the sea.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Three Munakata Goddesses】**

This shrine enshrines the three daughters of Amaterasu Omikami (the sun goddess): **Tagorihime**, **Tagitsuhime**, and **Ichikishimahime**.

- **Okinoshima (Okitsumiya)**: The solitary island 60km from the mainland, where the eldest daughter, Tagorihime, resides.
- **Oshima (Nakatsumiya)**: The middle island, where the second daughter, Tagitsuhime, resides.
- **Tajima (Hetsumiya)**: The main shrine on the mainland, where the youngest daughter, Ichikishimahime, resides, and which we can visit.

These three goddesses command the sea's mist and waves, safeguarding maritime and traffic safety. They are also revered as **'Michihiraki (path-opening)'** deities who guide people onto the right path in the long journey of life.

#### **【Origins and History: Okinoshima, the Island Where Gods Dwell】**

The history of Munakata Taisha is the history of ancient exchange between the Korean peninsula and the continent itself. From the 4th to the 9th century, countless treasures were offered on Okinoshima to pray for safe voyages, which have remained intact to become the **'80,000 national treasures.'**
To this day, Okinoshima remains a forbidden sanctuary where women are not allowed, and even men can only enter after undergoing a strict purification ritual. In recognition of this sanctity and historical value, it was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2017.

### 2. 🌲 Strolling the Grounds: Encountering National Treasures and a Sacred Forest

The place accessible to the general public for worship is the **'Hetsumiya'** on the mainland. Even here, you can fully experience the mystique of Okinoshima.

#### **Honden and Haiden (Main and Worship Halls)**

The Honden (main hall), a designated National Important Cultural Property, is an elegant structure reconstructed in 1578. Offer a reverent prayer before the wooden architecture, with its gracefully curved roof and traces of time.

#### **Takamiya Saijo (Ancient Ritual Site)**

Follow the forest path behind the main hall to find the **'Takamiya Saijo,'** the most sacred place and the origin of Munakata Taisha. It is an ancient ritual site composed only of trees and stones, without any buildings. Standing here, you can feel a thrill as if the mystical energy of ancient times envelops your entire body. (A highly recommended power spot!)

#### **Shinpokan (Treasure Museum)**

This is where the **80,000 national treasures** excavated from Okinoshima are stored and exhibited. Artifacts that showcase the essence of ancient East Asian exchange, such as golden rings, Persian glass bowls, and bronze mirrors, are breathtaking to behold. It's an essential stop that you must visit after praying at the shrine.

#### **Daini-gu & Daisan-gu (Second & Third Shrines)**

Next to the main hall are the Daini-gu and Daisan-gu, which enshrine the two older sister goddesses (Tagorihime and Tagitsuhime) from the islands. By praying here, it is as if you are meeting all three goddesses without having to cross the sea to the islands. These buildings are especially significant as they were relocated from the former main sanctuary of Ise Grand Shrine.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Protecting Your Safety and Luck

As the headquarters of traffic safety, souvenirs related to safety are prominent.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Munakata Taisha features a harmonious blend of powerful calligraphy for **'奉拜 (Hohai - Worship)'** and **'宗像大社 (Munakata Taisha)'**, along with the shrine's seal. Be sure to check for limited-edition Goshuin commemorating its World Heritage registration.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Traffic Safety Amulets**: This is where Japan's first amulet specifically for cars was created. Vehicle stickers or keychain-style amulets make the perfect gift for drivers.
- **Michihiraki (Path-Opening) Amulets**: These charms are for those at a crossroads in life, helping to guide them in the right direction.
- **Fishing Safety Amulets**: Befitting a sea deity, amulets for the safety and abundant catches of fishermen are also popular.
