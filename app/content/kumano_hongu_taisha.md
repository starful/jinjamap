Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' where we explore and document mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a place deep in the mountains, often called the spiritual heartland of Japan. Amidst the overlapping peaks of the Kii Mountains, a sacred river and forest are revealed as the mist clears. This is the Kumano Kodo, a path that countless people have walked for over a thousand years in straw sandals to cleanse their sins and gain a new life.

At the heart of this arduous yet beautiful pilgrimage route lies **Kumano Hongu Taisha (熊野本宮大社)**, the head shrine of over 3,000 Kumano shrines nationwide. This is not merely a place for wishing. It is a sacred site of "rebirth (甦り, Yomigaeri)," which once accepted all who sought salvation—from imperial family to commoners, regardless of age, gender, or status—in such numbers that it was called the "ant pilgrimage to Kumano."

From the giant torii gate nestled in overwhelming nature to the story of the three-legged crow, a divine messenger, and the history of the shrine's rise from the pain of a great flood. Today, let's embark on a pilgrimage with me into the soul-healing forests of Kumano.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Promise of Revival and Salvation

Before entering the shrine, we must first understand the stories of the gods dwelling at its heart to grasp why this place is called the "land of rebirth." The history of Kumano Hongu Taisha reveals a unique worldview where mythology and Buddhism are beautifully intertwined.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Saviors Connecting the Past and Future】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Ketsumimiko-no-Okami (家津美御子大神)**. In mythology, this deity is identified with Susanoo-no-Mikoto (素盞鳴尊), a symbol of valor.

However, the true charm of Kumano faith lies in the "Shinbutsu-shūgō (神仏習合)" philosophy, which sees Japan's native gods (神) and Buddhist figures (仏) as one. People believed that Ketsumimiko-no-Okami was an incarnation (Gongen, 権現) of the compassionate **Amida Nyorai (阿弥陀如来)** on Japanese soil. Amida Nyorai is the Buddha who presides over rebirth in the Pure Land in the afterlife. Thus, a pilgrimage to Kumano Hongu Taisha was not just about healing the pains of this world but a grand journey of salvation that promised peace even after death.

In addition to the main deity, several other gods who govern the nature and history of Kumano are enshrined in the main hall.

- **Hayatama-no-Okami (Yakushi Nyorai, who cleanses the sins of the past)**
- **Kumano-Musubi-no-Okami (Senju Kannon, who forges connections)**
- **Amaterasu Omikami (The ancestral goddess of the Japanese Imperial Family)**

In this way, Kumano is a sanctuary that transcends time and space, where one can cleanse past sins (past), form present connections (present), and attain future salvation (future).

#### **【Origins and History: The Scars and Revival from a Great Flood】**

The origins of Kumano Hongu Taisha date back to the reign of the 10th Emperor Sujin. According to legend, the shrine began when gods descended as three moons and landed in an oak tree on **Oyunohara (大斎原)**, a large sandbank where the Kumano and Otonashi rivers meet.

From the Heian to the Kamakura period, this place was revered as the "entrance to the Pure Land (paradise)" and gained explosive popularity. Retired Emperor Shirakawa visited nine times, and Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa made the arduous mountain journey a staggering 34 times. The open spirit of Kumano, which "rejects none who come," regardless of status, gender, or disability, became a beacon of hope for countless common people.

However, trials befell this land of the gods, which seemed eternal. In 1889 (Meiji 22), a record-breaking flood inundated the Kumano River. The massive torrent instantly swallowed the magnificent shrine buildings at Oyunohara. Although most structures were lost, people did not despair. They recovered the sacred objects from the muddy waters and gathered the remaining lumber to move and rebuild the shrine at its current mountainside location in 1891.

Thus, today's Kumano Hongu Taisha is also a symbol of **'revival' and 'rebirth.'** The shrine's history of overcoming disaster and rising again sends a silent message of encouragement to modern people facing failure and frustration: "You, too, can start over."

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Sacred Forest and the Giant Torii

Now, let's begin our walk through the shrine grounds. The phytoncides emitted by the dense cedar forest and the tranquil air will welcome you.

#### **158 Stone Steps and the Majestic Main Hall (本殿)**

The pilgrimage begins by passing through the entrance torii and climbing 158 steep stone steps. Each step may leave you breathless, but the process itself is like a ritual of shedding one's burdens. On both sides of the stairs, banners reading 'Kumano Daigongen (熊野大権現)' flutter in the wind, cheering on the pilgrims.

After passing through the Shinmon (神門, sacred gate) at the top of the stairs, the majestic main hall finally reveals itself.
The deep brown of the **'Hiwadabuki (檜皮葺)'** roof, made of layered cypress bark, harmonizes perfectly with the surrounding greenery. There is no ornate gold leaf or colorful paint, but an overwhelming serenity and dignity that makes you bow your head instinctively. (※ Note: Photography is strictly prohibited in the sacred area inside the Shinmon. Please put your camera away for a moment and capture the scenery with your eyes and heart.)

#### **The Divine Messenger, Yatagarasu (八咫烏) Post**

Look beside the worship hall (Haiden), and you'll find a unique black postbox. This is the **'Yatagarasu Post.'**
Yatagarasu is a legendary three-legged crow, an incarnation of the sun and a divine guide. In mythology, when the first Emperor Jimmu lost his way, Yatagarasu appeared and safely guided him from Kumano to Yamato (Nara).

This postbox symbolizes "showing the way to those who have lost their path in life." If you mail a postcard from here, it will be delivered with a special postmark shaped like Yatagarasu. Why not send a message of hope to your future self or a loved one?

#### **Oyunohara (大斎原) and Japan's Largest Otorii (大鳥居)**

After visiting the current main hall, you must walk to the former shrine site, **Oyunohara**, about a 10-minute walk away.
In the middle of the rice fields, do you see a massive structure soaring towards the sky? This is **Japan's largest Otorii**, standing 33.9 meters high and 42 meters wide.

This giant gate stands guard at the entrance to the old sacred grounds that were lost to the flood. Standing beneath the torii, one feels infinitesimally small. Oyunohara is now just a forest and an open field, but it was once densely packed with numerous shrine buildings. This vast, empty space, swept by the river breeze, now exudes an even more powerful spiritual energy than when it was full. The silhouette of the Otorii against the setting sun is a spectacular sight you will never forget. This is the power spot where the energy of 'rebirth' is most strongly concentrated.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Proof of Pilgrimage

Here are some special items to help you cherish the moving experience of Kumano.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kumano Hongu Taisha is powerful and intense. Over the bold calligraphy of '熊野本宮大社', a red seal depicting the divine messenger, **Yatagarasu**, is stamped.
Also, pay special attention to the special talisman called **'Kumano Goōhōfu (熊野牛王神符)'**. At first glance, it looks like a black drawing, but a closer look reveals that the characters are cleverly formed by combining illustrations of 88 crows. In ancient times, this was used not just as a talisman but as a written oath. It was a fearsome but powerful charm that implied, "If I break this promise, the crows will die, and I will spit blood." It is said that keeping it at home will ward off evil and repel thieves.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yatagarasu Amulet**: As a god who guides the way, it is believed to be particularly effective for **traffic safety** and **safe travels**. Also, because the emblem of the Japan national football team is the Yatagarasu, it is a popular amulet for praying for **victory (必勝)** in sports or competitions.
- **Yomigaeri (Rebirth) Amulet**: Recommended for those seeking to overcome failure or illness, this amulet embodies the very identity of Kumano.

### 4. ♨️ Nearby Attractions: Healing Hot Springs and Cuisine

A Kumano pilgrimage is inextricably linked with onsen (hot springs). Ancient pilgrims performed a ritual called 'Yugori (湯垢離),' purifying their bodies in hot spring water before visiting the shrine.

#### **1. Yunomine Onsen (湯の峰温泉)**

- **Why We Recommend**: One of Japan's oldest hot springs, boasting a history of 1,800 years. It's a 15-minute bus ride from the shrine. The smell of sulfur and the steam rising along the valley evoke a nostalgic atmosphere.
- **Tsuboyu (つぼ湯)**: The only 'bathable hot spring' registered as a World Heritage site. It's a small bath emerging from a rock crevice, and its water is said to change color seven times a day. (Wait times can be long, so get a numbered ticket as soon as you arrive!)

#### **2. Kawayu Onsen (川湯温泉)**

- **Why We Recommend**: A mystical place where hot spring water gushes out when you dig into the riverbed. In summer, you can enjoy swimming and bathing at the same time. In winter (December-February), a massive open-air bath called **'Sennin-buro (仙人風呂)'** is created by damming the river. An open-air bath in the great outdoors under a star-filled night sky is pure romance.

#### **3. Cuisine: Mehari-zushi (めはり寿司)**

- **What to Try**: The soul food of the Kumano region. It's a simple dish of a rice ball wrapped in a pickled mustard green (takana) leaf, but its salty flavor is superb. The name comes from the phrase "so delicious you eat it with your eyes wide open (mehari)." It was a lunch box that sustained pilgrims on their journey and can still be found in restaurants throughout the area.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Kumano Hongu Taisha may not be a tourist destination overflowing with flashy attractions. However, the serenity of the main hall encountered after the sweat of climbing 158 stone steps, and the comfort of nature felt beneath the giant Otorii, offer a profound resonance that cannot be experienced anywhere else.

When you feel lost in life, or when you want to start something new, visit the forests of Kumano. The divine messenger Yatagarasu will guide you on the path you should take, and the primeval forest will warmly embrace your weary soul and help you rise again. Because this is the land of 'rebirth.'

**JinjaMap** will return with another story of a beautiful sacred site in Japan to enrich your soul. May the blessings of the gods be with you on your journey! 🌿⛩️

### ♨️ Relax at a Nearby Onsen: Yunomine Onsen (湯の峰温泉)

A short 15-minute bus ride or a scenic 1-hour hike over the mountain will bring you to **Yunomine Onsen**, one of Japan's oldest hot spring villages with over 1,800 years of history. Pilgrims of old would perform purification rituals in these mystical, color-changing waters before visiting Kumano Hongu Taisha. Don't miss the chance to bathe in "Tsuboyu," the small, rock-enclosed bath that is the only hot spring registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site, where you can soak in the same healing waters as emperors and nobles from centuries past.
