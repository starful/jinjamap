  that Binds Love and Fulfills Toyotomi Hideyoshi''s Wish'
---

Hello, this is the editor from **'JinjaMap'**, where we introduce hidden sacred sites from around the world.

Osaka is a city full of dazzling neon signs and delicious food. But did you know that in the midst of this bustling city, a quiet and mystical forest lies hidden, like a gateway to another dimension? Just southeast of the magnificent Osaka Castle, basking in the sunlight that filters through the forest of buildings, is a place that has stood for a thousand years: **'Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine (玉造稲荷神社)'**.

This is no ordinary local shrine. It is steeped in the pride of the artisans who created the 'Magatama' (beads), a symbol of ancient Japanese imperial power, and it is the guardian shrine where Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the unifier of Japan, prayed fervently for the protection of Osaka Castle. It is also a romantic sanctuary inhabited by 'foxes' that are said to mend broken bonds and help new love blossom.

Are you tired of the typical Osaka tourist spots? If so, join me on a special journey through time to Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine, where the breath of history and the mystery of myth coexist.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Hands That Crafted Beads and the Prayers of a Unifier

The shrine's name, 'Tamatsukuri (玉造),' means 'to make beads.' This name itself suggests the extraordinary history this place holds.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of Abundance, Beauty, and Skill】**

Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine enshrines several deities together, and a look at them reveals why this place is considered a sacred site for 'success' and 'love.'

- **Ukanomitama-no-Ookami (宇迦之御魂大神)**: This is the deity we commonly refer to as 'Inari.' Originally the god who governed the abundance of the five grains, over time, this deity came to be revered as a god who aids in commercial prosperity and business success. This is why the merchants of Osaka hold this shrine so dear.
- **Shitateruhime-no-Mikoto (下照姫命)**: The daughter of the nation-building god Ookuninushi, she is a goddess of dazzling beauty and wisdom who, as her name suggests, brightly illuminates the world. She is a compassionate deity who protects a woman's beauty and forges relationships between men and women (enmusubi).
- **Amenohohi-no-Mikoto & Wakumusubi-no-Kami**: They govern technology/industry and vitality/growth, respectively. A fitting arrangement for the patron deities of ancient artisans.

#### **【Origin and History: From the Sweat of Artisans to the Guardian of Osaka Castle】**

The history of this site dates back to 12 B.C., during the reign of the 11th Emperor Suinin. At that time, a group of artisans called the **'Tamatsukuribe (玉造部)'**, who crafted sacred beads (magatama) for the imperial court, lived in this area. The shrine originated as a place where they enshrined their ancestral gods, praying for the refinement of their skills and the well-being of their clan. The history of the Curved Jewel (magatama), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan, breathes within these grounds.

As time passed into the Warring States period, **Toyotomi Hideyoshi**, who unified the nation, designated this shrine as the guardian (chinjusha) of Osaka Castle upon its construction. This was due to its crucial location, which, according to Feng Shui, protected the castle from the kimon (unlucky direction). Hideyoshi's mother, O-mandokoro, and his wife, Yodo-dono, were deeply devoted to this shrine. In particular, when her son Hideyori was born, Yodo-dono buried his **umbilical cord and placenta (ena, 胞衣)** here, praying with tears that her son would become the master of Osaka Castle and live a long, healthy life.

Although the Toyotomi clan perished and the shrine was burned down in the Siege of Osaka, it was rebuilt through the faith of the people and continues its profound history to this day.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Matchmaking Foxes and the Umbilical Cord Mound

The grounds are not large, but they are filled with gem-like spots that will make you pause.

#### **The Couple Fox Statues (夫婦キツネ像): A Token of Love**

Pay attention to the pair of fox statues guarding the front of the worship hall. Unlike the usual solemn fox statues, the foxes here look very affectionate. The mother fox on the left holds a lovely cub in her arms, while the father fox on the right holds a sacred jewel in his mouth, and they gaze at each other. This **'couple fox'** is said to grant wishes for marital harmony, family happiness, and for those seeking a good partner, making it a famous spot for romantic fulfillment. It's not uncommon to see couples taking pictures with their cheeks pressed together.

#### **Hoezuka Daimyojin (胞衣塚大明神): Weaving the Threads of Fate**

This is the spot on the grounds where the most powerful energy can be felt. It is the very place where Toyotomi Hideyori's umbilical cord is buried.
The umbilical cord, which connects a mother and child, symbolizes the strongest 'thread of connection.' Therefore, this place is not only for **couples wishing for children** or praying for a **safe childbirth**, but it is also known as a supreme power spot for mending broken relationships or firmly tying new ones (enmusubi). Standing before the stone mound beyond the torii gate, quietly envision the connections in your heart.

#### **Naniwa-Tamatsukuri Museum**

In a corner of the shrine, a small museum displays ancient magatama and pottery excavated from the area. It is a precious space where you can feel the breath of the artisans who toiled to carve beads here 2,000 years ago. (Free admission, opens upon request)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms: Capturing the Spirit of the Magatama

The charms and souvenirs of Tamatsukuri Inari Shrine perfectly capture its unique identity.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin, with '玉造稲荷神社' written in neat calligraphy, is stamped with the shrine's symbol, a magatama, or an Inari seal. There are also limited-edition goshuin with seasonal stamps like cherry blossoms or autumn leaves, which collectors won't want to miss.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Magatama Charm (勾玉まもり)**: This is the signature item here. Magatama-shaped charms in various colors like lustrous jade green, red, and clear crystal are believed to have a powerful ability to ward off evil and bring good fortune. They are also beautiful to keep as a necklace or a phone strap.
- **Love Fox Ema (恋キツネ絵馬)**: An adorable ema shaped like two foxes forming a heart. If you write the name of your crush or your ideal partner on the back and hang it up, the love fox will deliver your feelings.
- **Thread of Fate (縁のひも)**: A sturdy braided charm inspired by the Sanada-himo braid of Sanada Yukimura. Couples can tie them for each other or attach them to their belongings to pray that their precious bond will never be broken.
