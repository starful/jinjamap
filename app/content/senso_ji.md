### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Golden Statue Caught in a Fisherman's Net

The beginning of Senso-ji is like a fairy tale.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (Gohonzon): Sho Kannon Bodhisattva】**

The main deity enshrined here is **Sho Kannon Bodhisattva**.
This is the bodhisattva who, with a compassionate heart, alleviates the suffering of all beings and grants their wishes. The Kannon of Senso-ji is particularly renowned for its powerful ability of **'wish fulfillment (shogan-joju)'**, drawing countless people with earnest prayers. However, the main statue is a **hibutsu (秘仏)**, a hidden Buddha, and is not shown to the public, being enshrined in the temple's inner sanctum.

#### **【Origin and History: A Miracle from 1,400 Years Ago】**

In the year 628, two brothers fishing in the Sumida River caught a **golden statue of Kannon** in their net. No matter how many times they cast the net back into the river, the statue always returned. Believing it to be sacred, the brothers took it to the village chief. The chief converted his own home into a temple to enshrine the statue, and this marked the beginning of Senso-ji, Tokyo's oldest temple.

Later, Tokugawa Ieyasu designated Senso-ji as the tutelary temple of the shogunate, and it flourished as the center of Edo culture. It suffered the tragedy of being mostly destroyed by the Great Kanto Earthquake and the Tokyo air raids, but through nationwide donations and efforts, it was rebuilt and now stands as a symbol of peace and revival.

### 2. 🏮 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Blessings of Red Lanterns and Incense Smoke

The path from Kaminarimon to the main hall is filled with sights to see.

#### **Kaminarimon (Thunder Gate)**

The symbol of Senso-ji! This gate features a giant red lantern, 3.9 meters tall and weighing 700 kg. On either side stand the guardians Fujin (god of wind) and Raijin (god of thunder), exuding an overwhelming presence. It is said that passing through this gate dispels misfortune and leaves only good fortune.

#### **Nakamise-dori (Shopping Street)**

After passing through Kaminarimon, a shopping street filled with the atmosphere of the Edo period unfolds. The aroma of freshly baked **'ningyo-yaki' (doll-shaped cakes)** and savory **'senbei' (rice crackers)** stimulates the senses. It's great fun to walk around while browsing the charming souvenirs.

#### **Hozomon Gate and Owaraji (Giant Straw Sandals)**

Behind the second gate, Hozomon, hang giant straw sandals called **'owaraji'**. They symbolize a warning to evil spirits: "A giant who wears such large sandals is guarding this place, so stay away." There is a belief that touching these sandals will strengthen your legs and ensure a safe journey.

#### **Main Hall and Jokoro (Incense Burner)**

Smoke constantly billows from the large incense burner in front of the main hall. Due to the belief that **'applying the smoke to an ailing part of the body will heal it'** and **'applying it to your head will make you smarter,'** the area is always crowded with people wafting the smoke towards themselves. In the main hall, quietly put your hands together in prayer and make a wish to Kannon. (Do not clap at temples!)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Temple Goods: Embodying the Compassion of Kannon

The items available at Senso-ji are full of traditional charm.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive a goshuin at the 'Yogodo Hall' to the west of the main hall. The goshuin, featuring the calligraphy for **'Sho Kanzeon (聖観世音)'** and a red seal, has a powerful feel to it. You can also receive a goshuin for Daikokuten (the god of wealth).

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Renge (Lotus Flower) Charm**: A representative charm for praying for physical and mental health and peace.
- **Kaminarimon Charm**: A traffic safety charm shaped like the red lantern. It's cute and makes a great souvenir.
- **Hato-mikuji**: A pigeon-shaped fortune slip, as pigeons are considered messengers of the gods.
