### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The Hongu (Main Shrine) and Okumiya (Inner Shrine) of Arayayama Shrine enshrine three deities who hold important positions in Japanese mythology. Knowing these deities is the first step to understanding the source of the shrine's power.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

- **Oyamatsumi-no-Kami (大山祇命)**
  As the main deity (主祭神), he is the great god who rules over mountains. Born between the creator gods of Japanese mythology, Izanagi and Izanami, he is considered the chief of all mountain gods (山神). The 'tsumi (祇)' in his name signifies a divine being, symbolizing both the abundance of the mountains and the sometimes harsh power of nature. Since ancient times, he has been deeply worshipped by people who live off the mountains—hunters, woodcutters, and miners. As the god who governs all blessings bestowed by the mountains (timber, minerals, food), he came to be revered as a deity who is the source of business prosperity and financial fortune.

- **Amaterasu Omikami (天照大御神)**
  She is the ancestor of the Japanese Imperial family and the supreme deity who symbolizes the sun. The fact that she, the main deity of Ise Grand Shrine (伊勢神宮) which oversees all shrines in Japan, is also enshrined here signifies that this is an incredibly important sacred site. Her light causes all things to grow and prosper, so alongside the mountain blessings of Oyamatsumi-no-Kami, she adds a powerful force that illuminates national prosperity and personal success.

- **Konohanasakuya-hime-no-Mikoto (木花開耶姫命)**
  She is the daughter of Oyamatsumi-no-Kami and a beautiful goddess widely known as the goddess of Mount Fuji. Symbolizing a beauty as fleeting yet brilliant as cherry blossoms, she is worshipped as a goddess of safe childbirth, child-rearing, and protection from fire disasters. As a personification of Mount Fuji itself, her presence clearly shows that Arayayama Shrine is a sacred place that directly receives the spiritual energy of Mount Fuji.

It is believed that the combination of these three deities—'the abundance of the mountains (Oyamatsumi)', 'the blessing of the heavens (Amaterasu)', and 'the divine power of Mount Fuji (Konohanasakuya-hime)'—come together to bestow powerful fortune upon those who visit.

#### **【Origins and History】**

The founding of Arayayama Shrine dates back to the Muromachi period (室町時代) in 1534 (Tenbun 3). Its beginning is steeped in a legend worthy of a film.

At the time, retainers of the Takeda clan (武田家), the warriors who ruled the region, were hunting at the foot of Mount Fuji. While wandering lost deep in the forest, a thick fog suddenly enveloped them. Unable to see even a step ahead, the group was overcome with fear, and all they could do was pray to the gods.

Just then, a white-haired old man appeared before them out of nowhere. Exuding a mystical aura, the old man said, **"This is a sacred mountain. If you are lost, ask the spirit of that mountain for the way,"** and then vanished as suddenly as he had appeared.

As the bewildered retainers proceeded in the direction the old man had pointed, the fog miraculously lifted, and before them stood a small but dignified shrine (祠). This was the beginning of Arayayama Shrine. Thankful for having their lives saved by the guidance of the mountain spirit, they restored the shrine and respectfully enshrined the mountain god, Oyamatsumi-no-Kami.

Thereafter, the shrine gathered deep faith, primarily from forestry workers who worked in the forests at the foot of Mount Fuji. Every day before entering the mountains, they prayed here for safety and a bountiful harvest. The act of 'entering the mountain to make a living' has expanded in the modern era to mean 'going to the company to make business prosper'. In other words, the ancient belief of building wealth by receiving the mountain's blessings has naturally evolved into today's blessings of 'business prosperity' and 'increased financial luck'.

In modern times, its fame spread nationwide after the famous Japanese business consultant Mr. Yukio Funai (舩井幸雄) introduced it as "a shrine that will ensure you never have trouble with money." It has since established itself as Japan's top sacred site for financial fortune, attracting a constant stream of corporate executives, self-employed individuals, and investors. This is not just a superstition, but rather a modern inheritance of the wisdom of our ancestors who prayed for prosperity by giving thanks for the blessings of nature and borrowing its power.

### 2. 境内 Strolling the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

Arayayama Shrine is actually divided into two locations. There is the 'Hongu' (Main Shrine), located at the foot of the mountain and easily accessible to all, and the 'Okumiya' (Inner Shrine), nestled deep in the forest at the 2nd station (合目) of Mount Fuji. While it is said that the true power lies in the Okumiya, it is believed that one must visit both places to receive the full blessing.

#### **Hongu (本宮): Entrance to the Sanctuary Connected to Daily Life**

**1) Haiden (拝殿) & Honden (本殿) - Hall of Worship & Main Hall**
The Haiden of the Hongu, situated peacefully in the forest, is not extravagant but is a dignified wooden structure that shows the passage of time. Visitors first compose themselves here and offer their greetings to the deity. The standard prayer etiquette is 'two bows, two claps, one bow' (二拝二拍手一拝). When clapping, the right hand is slightly lowered to make a sound, which signifies respect for the deity. Behind the Haiden lies the Honden, the most sacred space where the deity resides. Although you cannot get close, its mere presence creates a solemn atmosphere.

**2) Okagai-ishi (お伺い石): The Mystical Stone that Asks the God's Will**
The most famous power spot at the Hongu is this 'Okagai-ishi' (the stone for asking). There are three round stones, and visitors can use them to divine whether their wish will be granted by the deity.

- **How to Experience:**
  1. First, respectfully bow to the deity.
  2. While concretely making a wish in your heart, lift one of the stones for the first time. Remember its weight.
  3. Make your wish earnestly once more, and then lift the stone a second time.
- **Interpretation:**
  If the stone feels **lighter** the second time you lift it, it is a sign that your wish will be granted with the deity's blessing. Conversely, if it feels heavier, it is a sign that the time is not yet right or that more effort is needed. The actual weight of the stone doesn't change, but it's said that the perceived weight changes depending on the heart and energy of the person praying, so be sure to give it a try.

#### **Okumiya (奥宮): Reaching the Heart of Mount Fuji**

About a 30-minute drive from the Hongu, up the Fuji Subaru Line to the 2nd station, you will finally arrive at the 'Okumiya'. This is a secret place that only opens from late April to November when there is no snow, and it truly overflows with primal natural energy.

**1) The Red Torii (鳥居), Entrance to the Sacred Precinct**
After parking your car, a vivid red torii stands at the entrance to a path leading deep into the forest. The moment you pass through this torii, you can feel a change in the very texture of the air. The energy of the mundane world disappears, and you enter the realm of the gods, filled only with the scent of earth, trees, and moss.

**2) Kanjo-resseki (環状列石 - Stone Circle)**
The core and most powerful spot of the Okumiya is the stone circle located behind the small shrine. The stones, artificially arranged in a circle, create a mystical atmosphere like an ancient altar. This spot is known as a "dragon hole" (龍穴, Ryūketsu), where the dragon veins (龍脈, Ryūmyaku) of Mount Fuji—the earth's energy—are said to surge up to the surface. Many visitors walk around these stones or stand in the center, close their eyes, and meditate, absorbing the spiritual energy of Mount Fuji with their whole body. Some say they can feel a warm or tingling sensation if they extend their hands, so try to quietly focus and feel the energy of the earth.

**3) The Small Shrine (祠)**
The shrine at the Okumiya is very small and simple, unlike the Hongu. However, the power it holds is by no means small. Here, you should once again offer your greetings to Oyamatsumi-no-Kami and express your gratitude for being safely guided to the heart of Mount Fuji. A visit to the Okumiya is less about 'making a wish' and more of a spiritual experience of becoming one with great nature.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Juyohin: Proof of Your Visit

The goshuin and omamori that help you cherish the memory of your visit are another joy of shrine pilgrimages.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

At Arayayama Shrine, you can receive goshuin with different designs from both the Hongu and the Okumiya.

- **Hongu Goshuin**: The shrine's name, '新屋山神社' (Arayayama Jinja), is written in a powerful script in the center. On the right, the phrase '富士山鎮座' (Enshrined at Mount Fuji) shows its identity. The vermilion shrine seal is stamped clearly, boasting a traditional beauty.
- **Okumiya Goshuin**: With a different design from the Hongu's, it has '新屋山神社 奥宮' (Arayayama Jinja Okumiya) written in the center. Since the Okumiya is only open for a limited period, receiving this goshuin is a testament to a special experience. Receiving both goshuin side-by-side gives a sense of accomplishment for completing the pilgrimage.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

As a sacred site for financial luck, there are many unique and reputedly effective items related to wealth.

- **Amulet for Increased Financial Luck (金運上昇お守り)**: This is the most popular and representative amulet. It is a gold-colored silk pouch containing a sacred talisman (神札) imbued with the deity's blessing. It is said that keeping it in your wallet or carrying it with you will attract wealth and resolve financial difficulties, making it the first item many people seek.
- **Oyamatsumi-no-Kami Card Amulet (大山祇命カード守り)**: A modern, card-style amulet. It's the perfect size to slip into a wallet or business card holder and is especially popular among businesspeople and sales professionals. It features an image of the deity and is said to provide reassuring strength during important contracts or negotiations.
- **Sacred Sand (御神砂)**: A small pouch containing sacred sand from the shrine grounds. Placing it at the entrance of a house or company is said to ward off bad energy and invite good fortune. There is also a custom of burying it in the ground when building a house or scattering it when opening a shop.

### 4. 🚶 Places to Visit Nearby: Attractions and Restaurants

After your visit to Arayayama Shrine, enhance your trip by enjoying the beautiful scenery and flavors around Mount Fuji and Lake Kawaguchiko.

**1. Lake Kawaguchiko (河口湖)**

The most famous and accessible of the Fuji Five Lakes. Simply strolling along the lakeside and admiring the ever-changing face of Mount Fuji is a healing experience in itself. You can take a sightseeing boat or ride the Kachi Kachi Yama Ropeway to an observation deck for a picturesque panoramic view of the lake and Mount Fuji together. It's about a 20-minute drive from the shrine, making it a great place to visit together.

**2. Oshino Hakkai (忍野八海)**

A set of eight mystical ponds where snowmelt from Mount Fuji, filtered through underground lava layers for decades, springs to the surface. The incredibly transparent and blue water is a marvel in itself. You can clearly see the aquatic plants swaying at the bottom of the ponds. You can take time to purify your mind while gazing at the clear water in a tranquil village landscape that feels like stepping into a traditional Japanese painting. It's located about a 30-minute drive from the shrine.

**3. Hoto Fudo (ほうとう不動)**

A specialty restaurant where you can taste 'Hoto' (ほうとう), a local dish from Yamanashi Prefecture. Hoto is a hearty and nutritious dish made with wide, thick noodles, pumpkin, mushrooms, and various vegetables simmered in a miso-based broth. The Hoto Fudo Kawaguchiko branch is particularly famous for its unique white dome-shaped architecture, reminiscent of an igloo or a cloud. Why not warm your slightly chilled body with a bowl of hot Hoto after your shrine visit?
