title: A Hidden Gem in Japan Praised by CNN! A Complete Guide to Yamaguchi's 'Motonosumi
  Shrine,' Where 123 Red Torii Gates Dance
---

On the edge of a cliff in Nagato, Yamaguchi Prefecture, where the rough waves of the blue East Sea crash into white foam, a scene so stunning it feels unreal unfolds. A path of 123 vibrant vermilion torii (鳥居) gates winds its way toward the blue sea like a writhing dragon. This is **Motonosumi Shrine (元乃隅神社)**, a place that captured the world's attention when it was named one of "Japan's 31 Most Beautiful Places" by CNN.

This is more than just a tourist spot with beautiful scenery. It is a sacred space imbued with the miraculous story that began with a white fox's mysterious revelation, the wonder of nature that seems to breathe with the sea dragon, and the earnest prayers of people hoping their wishes will reach the heavens. Today, I invite you to join me on a pilgrimage to this special holy site, where majestic nature and deep faith intertwine. I hope this will be more than a visual journey—a time to enter the heart of the shrine and feel its sacred energy and stories with your entire being.

### 1. A Miracle Built by Divine Revelation: The Deities and Origins

The story of any shrine begins with the god enshrined there, the 'Gosaishin' (御祭神). To understand the essence of a shrine, one must first delve into its heart—the enshrined deity and the story of its founding. The tale of Motonosumi Shrine is all the more dramatic because it originates not from ancient mythology, but from a mystical experience that happened in modern times.

#### **A Message from the White Fox (Byakko)**

The main deity enshrined at Motonosumi Shrine is **'Byakko Daishin'**, the White Fox Deity. In Shinto (神道), Japan's native faith, foxes are considered messengers (tsukai) of 'Inari Ōkami' (稲荷大神), the god of grain and prosperity. They are spiritual intermediaries who convey the will of the gods to humans and deliver human prayers to the gods.

Thanks to this background, Motonosumi Shrine is revered as a place of powerful blessings that encompass almost all aspects of human life: from essential prayers for a fishing village like business prosperity, bountiful catches (hōryō), and maritime safety, to good relationships (ryōen), childbirth (kosazuke), warding off evil and inviting good fortune (kaiun-yakuyoke), traffic safety, and academic success. Worshippers who visit this cliffside shrine each come to convey the earnest wishes in their hearts to the white fox.

#### **A History that Began in a Fisherman's Dream**

The history of Motonosumi Shrine is not long, but its beginning is as mystical as a folktale. In 1955 (Showa 30), a strange thing happened to Hitoshi Okamura (岡村斉), a fisherman who had spent his entire life with the sea in the Yuyatsuo (油谷津黄) area.

Every night, a white fox began to appear in his dreams. At first, he didn't think much of it, but the fox persistently stayed by his bedside and one night whispered:

> "I am a being who has resided in this land for a very long time, watching over you all. I am a deity whose spirit was divided (bunrei) from the distant Taikodani Inari Shrine (太皷谷稲成神社) in Tsuwano, Shimane Prefecture, yet why have you neglected to properly enshrine me for so long? Have you forgotten that your boats returning full and the peace of your village are all thanks to my protection? Enshrine me here as a god immediately. If you do, I shall bestow even greater fortune upon you and all who live in this land."

This vivid dream, like an oracle, shook Mr. Okamura to his core. He intuited that this was not a mere dream but a solemn revelation from a god. He immediately gathered the villagers and, on the very spot indicated by the white fox—the cliff lashed by fierce waves—they built a small shrine and began to worship the deity. This was the birth of Motonosumi Shrine.

The shrine's name, 'Motonosumi' (元乃隅), also holds a deep meaning. 'Moto' (元) means origin, and 'Sumi' (隅) means corner. This reflects its status as an 'original place' where the deity resides, as well as its geographical location at the westernmost 'corner' of Japan's main island, Honshu. After the shrine was built, the village was blessed with miraculously continuous bountiful catches, accidents decreased, and testimonies poured in from people whose prayers at the shrine had been answered.

The tunnel of 123 red torii gates, dedicated over a ten-year period starting in 1987, has become the symbol of this shrine and a testament to its faith. The act of dedicating a torii is an expression of gratitude for a wish fulfilled or a prayer for future prosperity. In other words, this 100-meter-long red path is a 'path of wishes,' silently testifying to how many miracles and thanks have occurred here over the past decades.

### 2. Walking the Path of the Red Dragon: A Stroll Through the Grounds and Power Spots

The grounds of Motonosumi Shrine are three-dimensionally arranged along the steep coastal cliffs, offering dramatically changing scenery with every step. It feels less like a simple visit and more like walking through a grand work of art created by nature and faith.

#### **Where Sky and Sea Meet: The Honden (Main Hall) and Haiden (Worship Hall)**

Passing through the torii tunnel and reaching the highest point of the cliff, you will find the modest yet dignified Honden and Haiden set against the open East Sea. They lack ornate gold leaf or massive architecture, but their appearance, having withstood the harsh sea winds for years, exudes a deeper sense of sanctity.

Standing before the Haiden, first, straighten your clothes and calm your mind. Follow the basic etiquette for shrine worship in Japan, 'Nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (Two Bows, Two Claps, One Bow).

1.  Bow deeply twice, bending at a 90-degree angle.
2.  Bring your hands together at chest height, slide your right hand down slightly, and clap twice with a distinct "clap, clap" sound.
3.  With your hands still together, make your earnest wish in your heart.
4.  Finally, bow deeply once more to express your gratitude.

The prayer offered amidst the vast ocean before you, the sound of waves crashing in your ears, and the wind brushing your cheeks creates a mystical sense of unity, as if your voice is traveling across the sea to reach the heavens directly.

#### **The 123 Red Tunnels: The Torii Path**

This is the overwhelming landscape that made Motonosumi Shrine famous and leaves visitors breathless. For about 100 meters, from the entrance on the coastal road to the tip of the cliff, 123 torii gates stand in a dense line.

Walking through this tunnel is a surreal experience. To the left is a lush green forest, and to the right, the piercing cobalt blue sea. The procession of intense vermilion torii cutting through this scene shows a dynamism, as if a red dragon is writhing its way down toward the sea. The sunlight filtering through the torii pillars creates a feast of light and shadow, and with each step through the tunnel, you may feel a sense of purification, as if the worries of the secular world are being washed away one by one. The name and date of the donor are inscribed on each torii pillar, a reminder that this path was created from the prayers of countless people.

#### **Challenge! Japan's Hardest-to-Reach Saisen Bako**

Motonosumi Shrine has a playful and challenging power spot you won't find anywhere else: the 'saisen bako' (賽銭箱, offering box) installed at the top of the large torii gate at the shrine entrance, about 6 meters above the ground.

Usually, offering boxes are placed on the ground, but here you must throw your coin toward the sky. A popular belief that "if you succeed in getting a coin into this box, your wish will surely come true" has turned this spot into a famous attraction where people of all ages try their luck with a smile. It is no easy feat to toss a small coin into a narrow box 6 meters high outdoors, with the sea breeze blowing.

Worshippers concentrate, pray, and throw their coins with all their might, each with their own form. A miss is met with sighs and laughter, while a success erupts in cheers and applause from everyone around. This process goes beyond simple fun; it gives meaning to the act of effort and concentration to achieve a wish, generating positive energy. Try as many times as it takes to succeed. A heart that doesn't give up may be the very key to making your wish come true.

#### **Nature's Breath: The Dragon Palace Geyser (Ryūgū no Shiofuki)**

After finishing your prayers at the shrine, turn your gaze toward the cliffs below to witness another marvel of nature: the 'Dragon Palace Geyser.' This phenomenon occurs when waves crash against the sheer rock face of the coastal cliff and are forced into a crevice (a sea cave), causing seawater to shoot up into the sky like a fountain along with compressed air.

Especially during autumn and winter when the north wind is strong and the waves are high, the water column can soar up to 30 meters. The sight of a white plume of water rocketing skyward with a thunderous "KWAAAAANG-" roar creates a spectacular scene, as if a dragon from the underwater Dragon Palace is ascending and roaring. On sunny days, a rainbow may form in the scattering droplets, adding to the mystique. It is the ultimate power spot where you can reflect on human existence in the face of nature's overwhelming power and absorb its abundant energy.

### 3. Proof of Worship: Goshuin and Souvenirs

If you've visited a shrine, you can't leave without a 'Goshuin' (御朱印) and amulets (omamori) to take its energy with you. The items at Motonosumi Shrine have a unique character, making them highly collectible.

-   **Goshuin (御朱印)**: The Goshuin here is very artistic. On top of the shrine's name written in powerful calligraphy and stamped with a red seal, the version with an illustration of the 123 torii gates, the blue sea, and a cute white fox is particularly popular. Every time you open your Goshuin-cho (stamp book), it will bring back memories of the beautiful scenery from that day. (Note: A priest may not always be present, so check in advance or you may be able to use a self-service station.)
-   **White Fox Amulet (白狐お守り)**: An amulet designed after the white fox, the messenger of the gods. It is said to hold the blessing of 'Jogan Joju' (諸願成就), the fulfillment of all wishes, and its cute design makes it a popular souvenir.
-   **Torii Amulet & Saisen Box Success Amulet**: Amulets shaped like the 123 torii gates to open up your luck, as well as witty amulets to pray for success in the difficult offering box challenge (or to achieve difficult goals in life) are also available.

### 4. Deepening Your Journey: Nearby Recommended Spots

The 'Kita-Nagato Kaigan Quasi-National Park', where Motonosumi Shrine is located, is a beautiful area that is healing just to drive through. For those who feel it's a shame to leave after only seeing the shrine, here are some recommended spots and restaurants to visit together.

#### **1. Tsunoshima Bridge (角島大橋)**

-   **Features**: A 1,780-meter-long bridge that cuts refreshingly across the emerald-green sea. It's one of Japan's top driving courses, featured in numerous car commercials and movies.
-   **Point**: The view from the observatory before crossing the bridge is magnificent. It's about a 20-30 minute drive from the shrine, making it a perfect addition to your itinerary.

#### **2. Senjojiki (千畳敷)**

-   **Features**: A highland plateau at an altitude of 333 meters, its name means 'as wide as 1,000 tatami mats.' The panoramic view of the East Sea horizon stretches beyond the vast grasslands.
-   **What to do**: Take a stroll while gazing at the open scenery, or relax with a coffee at the 'Country Kitchen' cafe located on the plateau. It's a 15-minute drive from the shrine.

#### **3. The Taste of Nagato: Live Squid Cuisine**

-   **Features**: Nagato is famous for its squid, especially the 'kensaki-ika' (sword-tip squid). The live squid sashimi (ika-ikizukuri), prepared immediately after being caught from a tank, is a delicacy with its transparent flesh and a firm, sweet chew.
-   **Recommendation**: After finishing the sashimi, having the remaining tentacles and fins prepared as tempura or salt-grilled is a special treat.

### 5. Access and Travel Tips

Motonosumi Shrine is somewhat difficult to access by public transportation, so using a rental car or a tourist taxi is the most convenient option.

-   **Location**: 498 Yuyatsuo, Nagato-shi, Yamaguchi-ken (〒759-4712)
-   **By Car/Rental Car**: It's more accurate to search on Google Maps rather than using a map code or phone number in your navigation system. The parking lot is paid.
-   **By Public Transportation**:
    -   Take the JR San'in Main Line to 'Nagato-Furuichi Station' (長門古市駅), then take a taxi for about 20 minutes (one way approx. 2,500-3,000 yen).
    -   You can also get off at 'Yuya Station' (油谷駅) and take a taxi.
    -   _Tip_: It's a good idea to get the taxi driver's business card for your return trip or negotiate a waiting time. Recently, 'shared taxis' or tour bus packages that visit major tourist spots are also available, so check the Nagato City Tourism Association website in advance.
-   **Visiting Hours**: You can visit freely from sunrise to sunset, but for safety, it is recommended to visit during daylight hours. It is very dark at night as there are no lights.

### 6. Editor's Closing Remarks

My time at Motonosumi Shrine was not just 'sightseeing,' but an 'experience.' The procession of red torii gates I faced at the cliff's edge showed me how beautiful human earnestness can be, and in the faces of people laughing as they tossed coins high into the air, I saw pure hope.

If you are tired from daily life and need a new source of energy, or if you have a desperate wish you want to come true right now, don't hesitate to head to Yamaguchi. The 123 red dragons dancing to the sound of the rough waves and the white fox waiting for you will gift you with an unforgettable miraculous energy. I sincerely cheer for your wish to land with a 'clink' in that high offering box.
