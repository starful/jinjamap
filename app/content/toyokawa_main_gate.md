Across Japan, there are paths of endless red torii gates, guarded by mystical fox statues. The name 'Inari' is deeply ingrained in our minds as a symbol of abundance and prosperity. However, even among the numerous Inari shrines, there is one that boasts an unparalleled status and history. This is **Toyokawa Inari (豊川稲荷)**, located in Toyokawa City, Aichi Prefecture.

Its official name is 'Enpukuzan Myogon-ji (円福山 豊川閣 妙厳寺),' a Buddhist temple of the Sōtō school, and it is a sacred site that showcases the essence of **'Shinbutsu-shūgō (神仏習合)'**, the beautiful fusion of Shinto and Buddhist boundaries. It has gained nationwide fame for the overwhelming scenery created by thousands of fox statues imbued with the wishes of countless visitors, and for its powerful blessings for business prosperity and financial fortune.

Today, we will open the gates of Toyokawa Inari, a place where layers of time have accumulated, and embark on a deep pilgrimage, following the myths, history, and sacred energy that flows within its grounds.

## 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

### 【Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】

The main deity enshrined at Toyokawa Inari is not the commonly known god of grains, 'Ukanomitama-no-kami (宇迦之御魂神).' The central figure here is a Buddhist guardian deity named **Toyokawa Dakinishinten (豊川吒枳尼眞天)**.

'Dakini' was originally an ancient Indian goddess, but upon being incorporated into Buddhism, she came to be worshipped as a powerful celestial being (Tenjin). She is often depicted riding a white fox, holding a sword in her right hand and a wish-granting jewel in her left, while carrying sheaves of rice. This appearance led to her natural integration with Japan's traditional Inari faith. Dakinishinten is known to ward off disasters and bring blessings, and is particularly renowned for showing great efficacy in **business prosperity, commercial success, household safety, and increased financial luck**, making her an object of absolute faith for merchants and business owners throughout Japan.

Thus, although Toyokawa Inari bears the name 'Inari,' its foundation is a Buddhist temple, and the deity it enshrines is the Buddhist Dakinishinten. This is its greatest feature and charm. It is a precious space where one can glimpse a unique facet of Japanese religious culture, where the Shinto Inari faith and the Buddhist Dakinishinten faith are perfectly harmonized.

### 【Origins and History】

The history of Toyokawa Inari is like a grand epic, tracing back about 600 years to the Muromachi period. Its beginnings lie with the renowned Kamakura period Zen master, **Kangan Giin (寒巌義尹)**.

While studying Buddhism in Song Dynasty China, Master Kangan Giin entered a deep meditative state just before his return journey. At that moment, a mystical being appeared before him. It was a beautiful celestial maiden riding a white fox and carrying sheaves of rice—Dakinishinten herself. Dakinishinten spoke to Kangan Giin:

> "I have been moved by your profound devotion to Buddhism. From this day forward, I will eternally protect you and those who follow your dharma lineage, granting their wishes and shielding them from calamity."

With this promise, Dakinishinten left behind a sacred image (聖像) of herself and vanished. Master Kangan Giin cherished this image, brought it back to Japan, and passed it down through generations of his disciples. The image was secretly transmitted through various temples, and its divine power was accessible only to chosen monks.

Time passed, and in 1441, Kangan Giin's 6th dharma descendant, Master **Tōkai Gieki (東海義易)**, founded a temple named 'Myogon-ji (妙厳寺)' in this land of Toyokawa. He enshrined the Dakinishinten image inherited from his master as the temple's chinju (鎮守, guardian deity). This marked the official beginning of what we know today as 'Toyokawa Inari.'

Initially a quiet training monastery, Myogon-ji gained national fame during the Edo period. Its connection with the daimyō **Ōoka Tadasuke (大岡忠助)**, renowned as a brilliant magistrate, was particularly fateful in changing its destiny. The Ōoka family had been devout followers of Toyokawa Inari for generations, and it is said that Tadasuke himself prayed to Dakinishinten daily. Rumors that his dazzling career success was due to the blessings of Toyokawa Inari spread throughout Edo (present-day Tokyo).

Hearing these rumors, countless merchants and commoners began making the long journey to Toyokawa to pray for wealth and success. The belief that "wishes come true if you pray to the Toyokawa deity" became firmly established, and Toyokawa Inari grew into a major center of faith, counted among the Three Great Inari Shrines of Japan. It is more than just a temple; it is a living history that has met the earnest desires of countless people throughout the ages and supported their lives.

## 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The vast grounds of Toyokawa Inari offer new landscapes and deep meanings with every step. Let's begin a sacred walk that goes beyond simple worship to feel the energy that resides within.

### 【Main Hall (本殿) & Hall of Worship (拝殿)】

Passing through the main gate (Sōmon) and entering the precincts, the first thing you encounter is the majestic and dignified Main Hall. Different from shrine architecture, it is a grand wooden structure characteristic of a temple, with the curves of its massive roof and intricate carvings overwhelming the viewer. This is the heart of the faith, where Dakinishinten is enshrined.

In front of the Main Hall, where the scent of incense faintly drifts, you do not perform the 'nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (two bows, two claps, one bow) like at a shrine. Instead, you perform the Buddhist-style **'gasshō-raihai (合掌礼拝)'**, quietly putting your palms together and making a wish in your heart. With a reverent mind, close your eyes and feel the presence of Dakinishinten. You will sense a calm yet powerful energy, created by the accumulated prayers of countless people filling this vast space.

### 【Symbolic Structure: Reikozuka (霊狐塚)】

One of the biggest reasons to visit Toyokawa Inari, and the place that most symbolically represents it, is the **Reikozuka (霊狐塚, Fox Mound)**. Follow the path behind the Main Hall into the dense forest, and an otherworldly, mystical scene unfolds before your eyes.

Over 1,000 fox statues, large and small, wearing red bibs, stand packed together. The foxes here are considered messengers (使者) of Dakinishinten. This scene was formed by a continuing tradition where people who had their wishes granted at Toyokawa Inari donate a fox statue in gratitude. In other words, the thousands of foxes lined up here are evidence of thousands of wishes fulfilled.

The sight of countless foxes among moss-covered rocks and trees is wondrous by day, and at dusk, it evokes a mystical and sacred atmosphere. Each fox has a different expression, creating the illusion that they are alive. Standing here, you might feel as if you can hear the whispers of the foxes, enveloped in a mysterious sensation where time seems to stand still. The Reikozuka is considered the most powerful **power spot** at Toyokawa Inari, so be sure to walk slowly and deeply absorb its energy.

### 【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】

- **Okunoin (奥の院):** Passing the Reikozuka and venturing deeper, you will find the Okunoin, filled with a tranquil and pure atmosphere. It is a more profound space of faith than the Main Hall, recommended for those who wish to pray with greater focus. Here, where ambient noise is blocked out and only the sounds of nature and your own breathing can be heard, you can collect your thoughts.
- **Shichifukujin Meguri (七福神めぐり):** Scattered throughout the precincts are stone statues of the Seven Lucky Gods, who bring wealth and fortune. The 'Shichifukujin Meguri,' or pilgrimage to visit and pray to each god, offers another kind of enjoyment. In particular, **Daikokuten (大黒天)**, who governs wealth, is popular among visitors praying for business prosperity. Why not try to find all seven gods like a treasure hunt, using a map of the grounds?
- **Mandoku-dō (万燈堂):** The Hall of Ten Thousand Lanterns, where thousands of lanterns are dedicated, is in itself a magnificent work of Buddhist art. The prayers of devotees contained in each lantern combine to create a bright, warm light. The atmosphere is especially fantastical in the evening when the lanterns are lit.

## 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Token of Your Visit

Here are the goshuin and special授与品 (juyohin, items bestowed by the temple) that will make the memory of your visit even more special.

### 【Goshuin (御朱印)】

The goshuin of Toyokawa Inari is like a powerful charm in itself. In the center, the honorific title of the enshrined deity, **'Hōhai Toyokawa Dakinishinten (奉拝 豊川吒枳尼眞天)'** (Worshipful Toyokawa Dakinishinten), is written in bold calligraphy. On the right is the temple's name, 'Toyokawa-kaku (豊川閣),' and in the center is a red seal stamped with a Sanskrit character (Siddham script) symbolizing Dakinishinten.

Simply receiving the goshuin can give you a sense of reassurance, as if you are under the protection of Dakinishinten. Limited edition goshuin designs may be available during New Year's or special ceremonies, so it is recommended to check the official website before your visit.

### 【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】

Toyokawa Inari offers many unique and highly effective items specialized for business prosperity and financial luck.

- **Yūzū Inari (融通稲荷) and Yūzūkin (融通金):** This is part of a unique belief here. You can receive a 10-yen coin charm in a yellow envelope called 'Yūzūkin.' It is said that if you keep this 10-yen coin as 'seed money' in your wallet, the flow of money will become smooth and your wealth will grow. Then, after one year, or when your wish is granted, it is customary to return it with gratitude by dedicating a larger amount than what you borrowed. For those praying for **financial luck**, this is the ultimate lucky charm to receive.
- **Fox-shaped Omikuji (おみくじ):** A cute white ceramic fox contains a paper fortune (omikuji). After checking your fortune, you can keep the ceramic fox as a small decoration, making it a very popular souvenir.
- **Kin'un Omamori (金運お守り):** A brilliantly crafted amulet in gold, it is believed to greatly enhance financial luck when kept in a wallet. It makes a great gift for business owners or those wishing for success in their investments.
