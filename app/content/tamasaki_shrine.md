Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap', where we seek out moments of rest in our daily lives.

Today, we're heading to Ichinomiya, a town at the eastern edge of Chiba Prefecture's Boso Peninsula, just over an hour by train from Tokyo, where the sound of the blue Pacific waves tickles your ears. This place, also famous as a surfing mecca, is home to **Tamasaki Shrine (玉前神社)**, a powerful spot that has been known since ancient times as the eastern starting point of a "Ley Line" (a path where sacred sites are aligned) and the first place the sun's energy touches.

This is more than just a shrine. It's a place where a magnificent sanctuary finished in jet-black lacquer, a mystical ritual of walking barefoot to receive the earth's energy, and the poignant story of a goddess from Japan's creation myths come to life. It is especially renowned as a guardian deity for women, a sacred site where the footsteps of those praying for good relationships or safe childbirth never cease.

Feel the sea-scented breeze as you embark on a special pilgrimage along the path of the sun. Shall we delve into the mystical charms of Tamasaki Shrine together?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: The Goddess from the Sea Who Opened the Sun's Path

The most exciting moment when visiting a shrine is encountering the story of the deity enshrined there. Tamasaki Shrine is connected to one of the most dramatic moments in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The Mother Goddess Who Protects Women's Lives】**

The main deity (主神) of Tamasaki Shrine is **Tamayorihime-no-mikoto (玉依姫命)**.
This beautiful goddess, whose name contains the character for 'jewel' (玉), is the daughter of the sea god (Watatsumi) and the mother of Japan's first emperor, Emperor Jimmu.

As a deity who embodies the life force of the sea, she possesses the following powerful blessings:

- **Matchmaking (縁結び)**: She helps people meet their significant others.
- **Safe Childbirth and Child-rearing**: She helps with conception and the healthy upbringing of children.
- **Guardian of Women**: She blesses women's health, happiness, and new beginnings.

Because of this, a saying has been passed down at Tamasaki Shrine since ancient times: "If a woman prays here, her wish will surely be granted."

#### **【Origins and History: The Eastern End of the Ley Line】**

The history of Tamasaki Shrine dates back to the age of myths.
After her elder sister, Toyotamahime, was seen in her true form (a shark or dragon) by her husband during childbirth and returned to the sea, her aunt, Tamayorihime, came to the land and devotedly raised her abandoned nephew (Ugayafukiaezu). She later married her nephew and gave birth to Emperor Jimmu, the founder of Japan. Tamasaki Shrine is known as the sacred place where she first stayed after coming from the sea.

What makes this place even more special is its geographical location.
If you draw a line westward from Tamasaki Shrine on a map, it connects to **Samukawa Shrine (Kanagawa) → Mt. Fuji (summit) → Mt. Minobu → Mt. Nanmen → Ise Grand Shrine → Mt. Yoshino → Takachiho Shrine**.
This line perfectly coincides with the path of the sun on the spring and autumn equinoxes and is called the **'Ley Line (Path of the Sun)'**. Tamasaki Shrine is the **eastern starting point (起點)** of this sacred path, meaning it is the first place in the Japanese archipelago to receive the sun's auspicious energy, making it a supreme power spot governing 'all beginnings' and 'life force'.

During the Edo period, it received generous protection from the Tokugawa shogunate and has been revered for over a thousand years as the 'Ichinomiya' (一宮), the highest-ranking shrine in this region (Kazusa Province).

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Black Sanctuary and Barefoot Prayers

Upon entering the precincts, the shade and tranquility created by the lush trees calm the mind. But the true charm of Tamasaki Shrine lies in the 'experience' beyond what meets the eye.

#### **【Ichinomiya-kuro (一宮黒): The Jet-Black Gongen-zukuri】**

The hall of worship (拝殿) and main sanctuary (本殿) you encounter after passing the main approach are overwhelmingly majestic. Unlike the typical red or natural wood-colored shrines, this one is finished with a deep, rich **black lacquer (黒漆)**. This is called 'Ichinomiya-kuro,' and the combination of the black base with gold decorations exudes a beauty that is both splendid and profoundly dignified.
This structure, built in the Edo period, is designated as a Tangible Cultural Property of Chiba Prefecture, and the intricate carvings on the main sanctuary, in particular, are mesmerizing.

#### **【Hadashi no Michi (はだしの道): A Time to Become One with the Earth】**

An absolute must-do experience at Tamasaki Shrine is walking the **'Barefoot Path'** that circles the main sanctuary.
It is a ritual where you take off your shoes and socks and walk **clockwise three times** on a path laid with smooth, white pebbles (sacred jade pebbles).

- **1st lap**: You'll feel a tingling pain in the soles of your feet. (Legend has it, the worse your health, the more it hurts!)
- **2nd lap**: Amidst the pain, you begin to feel the cool energy of the earth and the acupressure effect.
- **3rd lap**: The pain soon turns into a refreshing coolness, and you can feel the negative energy in your body being released through the soles of your feet.

This path, with its legend that "walking barefoot grants your wish," is Tamasaki Shrine's most powerful purification (detox) spot. The warm, tingling sensation in your feet after the walk is proof that you have properly received the earth's energy.

#### **【Power Spots: Sazare-ishi and Masakaki】**

- **Sazare-ishi**: Mentioned in the Japanese national anthem, this is the "rock formed from tiny pebbles," a symbol of eternity.
- **Masakaki (sacred tree)**: A sacred tree towering beside the hall of worship. Stand before this tree that has withstood hundreds of years, quietly place your hand on it, and receive a share of its life force.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Offerings: Blessings of the Moon and Waves

Here are some of Tamasaki Shrine's unique offerings that allow you to cherish the memory of your visit. The amulets here are famous for their beautiful designs.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Tamasaki Shrine is full of grace. The red stamp **'上総國一之宮 (Kazusa-no-kuni Ichinomiya)'** is clearly imprinted, testifying to the high status of the shrine.
The **Goshuin-cho (stamp book)** here is particularly popular, featuring designs of blue, billowing waves and the moon in the night sky, befitting a shrine dedicated to a sea goddess.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

The omamori (amulets) here perfectly blend modern sensibility with traditional meaning.

- **Tsukimichi Omamori (月満ち守り)**: Meaning 'the waxing moon'. It is said that a woman's body rhythm is closely linked to the moon. This amulet, with its enchanting moon design, is a prayer for a woman's health, safe childbirth, and happiness to become as full as the full moon.
- **Naminori Omamori (波乗り守り)**: An amulet fitting for Ichinomiya, the mecca of surfing. Shaped like a surfboard, it not only signifies a prayer for riding waves well but also carries the deeper meaning of **'successfully riding the rough waves (hardships) of life to achieve success'**. It's the perfect gift for someone about to take on a new challenge.
- **Tama no Omamori (珠の守)**: A round amulet modeled after the 'tama' (玉, jewel) in the deity's name, it is a prayer for all matters to be resolved smoothly and 'roundly'.

### 4. 🌊 Nearby Attractions: Surfing, Cafes, and the Sea

Just a 5-10 minute drive from the shrine, the trendy charms of Ichinomiya await.

#### **1. Tsurigasaki Beach (釣ヶ崎海岸)**

- **Why we recommend it**: This is the very spot where the surfing events of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were held. Try visiting with the 'Naminori Omamori' you received from the shrine. The unique torii gate standing on the beach creates a mystical scene, as if the realms of the sea and the gods meet. It's also a famous sunrise spot, so an early morning visit to witness the beginning of the ley line with your own eyes is highly recommended.

#### **2. Cliffside Cafe 'GAKE'**

- **Why we recommend it**: As its name suggests, this cafe is precariously built on the edge of a cliff (gake). The endless horizon of the Pacific Ocean outside the window is truly a spectacular sight. The vintage interior, delicious desserts, and overwhelming ocean view combine to make it the perfect place for an 'Instagram-worthy shot'.

#### **3. Kujukuri Beach (九十九里浜)**

- **Why we recommend it**: This is Japan's largest sandy beach. You can enjoy a drive along the long, bow-shaped coastline, and there are numerous restaurants where you can savor fresh grilled clams (hamayaki).
