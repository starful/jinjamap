Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find hidden gems of sacred sites around the world.

Today, I'll guide you to the heart of **'Mt. Iwaki (岩木山),'** a symbol of Aomori Prefecture, the northernmost tip of Honshu, Japan. Nestled on the beautiful slopes of this mountain, called 'Tsugaru Fuji' for its resemblance to Mt. Fuji, is **'Iwakisan Shrine (岩木山神社),'** which has protected this land for over a thousand years.

Thanks to its splendid decorations, comparable to Nikkō Tōshō-gū, this place is known as **'Okunikkō (Nikkō of the North).'** From the clear spring water flowing between its majestic structures to the mysterious legend of icicles that grow upside down. Shall we embark on a healing journey to Iwakisan Shrine, a place filled with the spirit of nature and the breath of history?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Meeting of a Mountain God and a Hero

Iwakisan Shrine is a sacred place that worships the mountain itself.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Five Gods】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Utsushikunitama-no-kami (Ōkuninushi)**. He is the protagonist of the 'nation-building' myth and is the god of **matchmaking**, **business prosperity**, and **medicine**.
Together with the other enshrined deities—**Tatsubihime-no-kami (goddess of the mountain)**, **Ōyamatsumi-no-kami (god of mountains)**, and **Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (a legendary general)**—a total of five gods protect **national peace**, **family well-being**, and **good fortune in competitions**.

#### **【Origins and History: 1,200 Years of Prayer】**

Its origins date back to 780, when a shrine was built on the mountain's summit. Later, in 800, the Seii Taishōgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro prayed to the deity of Mt. Iwaki for victory in battle. After succeeding, he rebuilt the shrine.
During the Edo period, the lords of the Tsugaru domain donated magnificent buildings over generations, creating the appearance that earned it the name 'Okunikkō' today. The main structures, including the Honden (main hall), Haiden (hall of worship), and Rōmon (tower gate), are all designated as **National Important Cultural Properties**.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Magnificent Architecture and Mysterious Water

The moment you step onto the grounds, you are greeted by overwhelming architectural beauty and crisp, clean air.

#### **The Majesty of Okunikkō, the Rōmon Gate and Haiden**

Passing through the massive **Rōmon gate** at the entrance reveals the splendid **Haiden**. The red lacquer, gold leaf, and intricate carvings of dragons and phoenixes are the epitome of Edo period craftsmanship. Whether in the snow-covered winter or the colorful autumn, the harmony between the red shrine and nature is a spectacular sight.

#### **The Upside-Down Komainu (狛犬)**

Take a close look at the pillars of the shrine's fence. You'll find unique komainu (guardian lion-dogs): one facing upwards (for rising fortune) and the other downwards (to ward off evil). It is said that taking a picture with them will boost your **financial luck** and **love life**.

#### **Misogi no Sen (Spring of Purification) & The Three Cedar Trees**

At the temizuya (water basin for purification) next to the Haiden, underground water from Mt. Iwaki gushes out. This is the legendary water said to **"clear your vision and strengthen your body if you drink it."** Be sure to bring a water bottle!
Next to it, the massive **'Three Cedar Trees (Sanbonsugi)'** stand as if piercing the sky. It is a power spot brimming with vibrant life force.
