### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: The Rice Ears that Turned Wasteland to Gold

First, let's explore the deep-rooted legend that explains why Ochobo-san is known as the 'God of Business Prosperity.'

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Trinity of Abundance and Prosperity】**

As one of Japan's three great Inari shrines, this place enshrines the following three deities:

- **Ōkuninushi-no-Mikoto**: The god of nation-building and forming connections. He helps forge the most crucial element in business: **'good relationships (with clients and customers).'**
- **Toyouke-hime-no-Mikoto**: The goddess who presides over abundant food and industry. She promises **'production and abundance.'**
- **Waku-musubi-no-Mikoto**: The god with the power to create and give birth to all things. He assists with business **'growth and development.'**

In other words, it's a perfect power spot that embodies the three key elements of business success: **'Connections - Abundance - Growth.'**

#### **【Origin and History: The Oracle that Raised a Clan】**

A thousand years ago, during the Heian period, Sumiyoshi Shigeuji of a prominent family moved to this area and faced the daunting task of cultivating a wasteland. One day, after praying earnestly, an old man appeared in his dream and gave him a divine message: "Enshrine the treasure left by your ancestors as a sacred object." When he opened the treasure box, he found resplendently shining **'golden rice ears.'**

As he enshrined the rice ears and followed the divine will, the barren land transformed into fertile fields, and his family amassed great wealth. The shrine built in gratitude is Chiyohoinari Shrine. As its name, meaning **'to preserve (保) for a thousand generations (千代),'** suggests, this place has been safeguarding the success of countless people for over a thousand years.

### 2. 🦊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Praying for Great Success with Fried Tofu and Business Cards

The way of worship at Ochobo-san is very unique and lively. Don't go empty-handed; be sure to pick up the necessary items at the entrance!

#### **Worship Essentials: Fried Tofu and a Candle**

It's standard practice to buy a **'bundle of fried tofu (abura-age) and a candle (50 yen)'** from a shop at the shrine entrance.

1. **Offering a Candle**: Place the candle in the candle offering hall (헌등소) and light it. This symbolizes the spirit of sacrifice, burning oneself to light up the world, which represents an entrepreneur's dedication.
2. **Offering Fried Tofu**: Place the fried tofu on the altar in front of the main hall. This is an offering to the fox deity, who loves fried tofu, as you make your wish. The massive pile of fried tofu is a truly unique sight here.

#### **The Worship Hall Adorned with Business Cards**

If you look closely in front of the worship hall (haiden), you will see countless business cards tucked into the structure. This is how entrepreneurs appeal to the gods, saying, "Please remember my business!" Be sure to bring a business card to plant your own seeds of success.

#### **The Heavy/Light Stone (Omokaruishi)**

Further inside the grounds, there is an **'Omokaruishi'** stone for divining whether your wish will be granted.

1. Make a wish in front of the stone.
2. Lift the stone.
3. **If it feels lighter than you expected, your wish will come true!** If it feels heavy, it means more effort is required. How much will your wish weigh?

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Kumade (Lucky Rake)**: The signature item of Ochobo-san! This is a decorative bamboo rake adorned with all sorts of lucky charms like rice bales, gold coins, and sea bream. It signifies **"raking in money and fortune,"** making it the ultimate charm to hang in your office or home. It is customary to replace it with a larger one each year.
