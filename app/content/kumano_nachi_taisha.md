  the Soul at Kumano Nachi Taisha'
---

Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover hidden gems and sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **'Kumano Nachi Taisha (熊野那智大社),'** a mystical sanctuary hidden deep within the lush forests of Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the 'Kumano Kodo' pilgrimage route, where countless pilgrims have walked, and the massive **Nachi Falls** roars, a history of faith spanning over 2,000 years breathes and lives.

A place where the 133-meter waterfall itself is a deity, where serene peace can be felt while walking through cedar forests, and where the legend of 'Yatagarasu,' the divine crow that guides the lost, is told.
For those who wish to cleanse their soul and dream of a new beginning, Kumano Nachi Taisha will offer an unforgettable experience. Shall we set off right now?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Mythology Born from a Waterfall

The faith of Kumano Nachi Taisha began with reverence for nature itself.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The God of Musubi】**

The main deity here is **Kumano Fusumi no Okami**. She is revered as the mother goddess who creates and nurtures all things, and as the deity of **'Musubi' (tying knots),** who forges connections between people.
This shrine is also known as the 'Jūnisho Gongen,' enshrining a total of twelve deities, making it a sacred place like a comprehensive gift set that grants various wishes.

#### **【Origin and History: The Guidance of Yatagarasu】**

When the first Emperor, Jimmu, was on his expedition to the east, he got lost in the rugged mountains of Kumano. It is said that a three-legged crow, **'Yatagarasu,'** sent by the sun goddess, appeared and guided him to Nachi Falls. The emperor, amazed by the mystique of the waterfall, held a ritual there, which became the origin of the shrine.
The waterfall itself is a deity (Hiro Shrine), and Nachi Taisha is the palace that enshrines it. Preserving a unique culture where Buddhism and Shintoism have merged, its value is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Heavenly Scene Atop 467 Steps

The path to the shrine is somewhat challenging, but the scenery that unfolds at the end is more than a reward.

#### **The 467 Stone Steps and the Vermilion Main Hall**

The pilgrimage begins with a climb up **467 stone steps**. Although it may leave you breathless, think of it as shedding your worldly desires with each step. At the top, a spectacular view unfolds, with the vermilion main hall, the green forest, and the distant sea all blending together.

#### **The Harmony of the Three-Storied Pagoda and the Waterfall (The Best Viewpoint)**

Head to the courtyard of Seiganto-ji Temple next to the main hall. There you will find one of Japan's most iconic views: the white, crashing **Nachi Falls** visible beyond the red **three-storied pagoda**. It's a place where every press of the shutter creates a picture-perfect shot.

#### **Hiro Shrine (Nachi Falls)**

After visiting the main hall, descend the stairs again to find **'Hiro Shrine'** right below the waterfall. It is a place of worship facing only the waterfall, without a main shrine building.

- **Experience**: Feel the spray from the 133-meter-high waterfall (a natural mist!), and for 100 yen, try drinking the **'Longevity Water' (said to extend your life)**. It feels like you are drinking the energy of the gods.

#### **Yatagarasu and the Camphor Tree**

Within the precincts stands a giant **camphor tree** that is 850 years old. It is said that passing through the hole in the tree's trunk, a ritual called 'tainai-kuguri' (passing through the womb), grants a long and healthy life. Also, don't miss the statue and postbox of the guiding crow, **'Yatagarasu.'**

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Sacred Items: Luck Delivered by the Crow

The sacred items here carry the meaning of 'guidance' and 'safety.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

Receiving the goshuin from both Kumano Nachi Taisha and Hiro Shrine (the waterfall) is the standard practice. The goshuin from Hiro Shrine is especially worth collecting as it features a drawing of the waterfall.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yatagarasu Charm**: The charm depicting the three-legged crow signifies **traffic safety**, **travel safety**, and **guidance onto the right path**. It's a must-have item for travelers or those undertaking new challenges. There is also a design featuring the crow stepping on a soccer ball (the symbol of the Japan national football team), making it popular for praying for victory.
- **Musubi Charm**: A charm imbued with the power of the deity who forges connections.

### 4. 🐟 Nearby Places to Visit: Ancient Roads and the Taste of Tuna

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the nature and cuisine of Kumano.

#### **1. Daimonzaka (Kumano Kodo)**

- **Location**: Below the shrine.
- **Features**: A stone-paved path lined with 800-year-old cedar trees. Renting and walking in the attire of ancient pilgrims (Heian period costumes) offers a special experience, like traveling back in time. It's perfect for taking photos!

#### **2. Nachikatsuura Fishing Port & Tuna**

- **Location**: 30 minutes by bus (near Kii-Katsuura Station).
- **Features**: This port boasts the largest catch of fresh tuna in Japan. The unfrozen, fresh **'nama-maguro don' (fresh tuna bowl)** simply melts in your mouth. You can also watch a tuna-cutting show or enjoy a footbath.
