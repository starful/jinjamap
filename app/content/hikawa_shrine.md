Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

While the glamour of Tokyo is wonderful, don't you sometimes dream of a healing journey away from the bustling city to clear your soul? Just a 30-minute train ride from Tokyo, in Omiya (大宮), the heart of Saitama Prefecture, lies a vast forest and a shrine that has watched over this land for over 2,400 years.

This is none other than the head shrine of the 280 Hikawa shrines in the Kanto region and the most prestigious shrine of Musashi Province (the area of modern-day Tokyo and Saitama): **'Omiya Hikawa Shrine (大宮氷川神社)'**.

The tranquility felt while walking along the endless path lined with zelkova trees, the pond steeped in mysterious legends, and above all, the powerful aura of 'matchmaking' (en-musubi). Today, I will guide you to Omiya Hikawa Shrine, where myth and history come alive.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: Meet the Mightiest Family of Mythology

Do you know why Hikawa Shrine is called a sacred place for 'matchmaking'? The secret lies in the special relationship of the gods enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): A Family of Love and Heroes】**

This is where a superstar family from Japanese mythology is enshrined.

- **Susanoo-no-Mikoto**: The god of storms and the sea, and a hero who vanquished the monstrous serpent 'Yamata no Orochi.' He wards off misfortune with his formidable power.
- **Kushinadahime-no-Mikoto**: The goddess rescued by Susanoo, who then became his wife. Their romance is one of the most dramatic love stories in mythology, symbolizing **marital harmony** and **family peace**.
- **Oonamuchi-no-Mikoto (Okuninushi)**: The descendant of the two gods and Japan's foremost **'god of matchmaking.'** He is skilled in forging all kinds of good connections, not just romantic love but also business partnerships, friendships, and more.

With such a powerful hero god, goddess of love, and god of connections gathered in one place, Hikawa Shrine is known as the ultimate power spot for those dreaming of **success in love**, **marriage**, and **mending relationships**.

#### **【Origin and History: A Sublime 2,400 Years】**

The history of Hikawa Shrine dates back to 473 BC, during the reign of the 5th Emperor Kosho. For over 2,400 years, it has reigned as the guardian deity of the Kanto region. The place name 'Omiya (大宮, great shrine)' itself is derived from this shrine, a testament to its absolute influence.
It was also the first place Emperor Meiji visited for worship after moving the capital to Tokyo, and it remains a high-ranking shrine to which imperial envoys are dispatched even today.

### 2. 🌲 Strolling the Grounds: Walking Japan's Longest Approach

The true essence of Hikawa Shrine can be felt from the moment you step off the train and onto the vast, forested path that begins almost immediately.

#### **Japan's No. 1 Approach (氷川参道)**

The approximately 2km-long path from the 'Ichi-no-torii' (first gate) to the shrine entrance is famous for being **the longest shrine approach in Japan**. The tunnel of about 650 zelkova trees, so dense they seem to cover the sky, feels as if it washes away the impurities of the mind just by walking through it. It is a beautiful walking course throughout the year, with cherry blossoms in spring, autumn leaves in fall, and deep green foliage in summer.

#### **The Sacred Red Bridge and Romon Gate (楼門)**

At the end of the path, a sacred red bridge (Shinkyo) appears, crossing over a holy pond. Beyond the bridge, the magnificent vermilion **Romon Gate (楼門)** boasts an overwhelming dignity. The moment you pass through this gate, you truly feel you have entered the divine realm, separated from the secular world.

#### **A Hidden Power Spot: The Serpent's Pond (蛇の池)**

While most visitors only see the main hall and leave, if you want to feel the real energy, head to the forest path behind the main hall. There, you will find a mystical spring called the **'Serpent's Pond.'** This place, where water has gushed forth since ancient times, is considered the birthplace of Hikawa Shrine, and clear water still springs up today. With its quiet and cool atmosphere, it is a powerful healing spot known only to those in the know.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing the Red Thread of Fate

Here are some special items to help you cherish the impression of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Hikawa Shrine is clearly stamped with the characters **'武蔵一宮 (Musashi Ichinomiya)'**, showcasing its high rank. The limited-edition goshuin that change with the seasons and the goshuin-cho (stamp book) featuring the shrine's symbolic cloud pattern (yakumo) are also very popular.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **En-musubi Amulet**: There are many lovely charms, with designs tied with a red thread or featuring cherry blossom patterns. Highly recommended for those waiting for a good connection.
- **Fuku Daruma (Good Fortune Daruma)**: A specialty of Omiya. Make a wish and paint one eye, and when the wish comes true, paint the other. It's a gift of the "seven times down, eight times up" spirit of resilience.

### 4. 🍡 What to See and Do Nearby: The Tastes and Sights of Omiya

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of Omiya Park and some delicious snacks.

#### **1. Hikawa Dango (氷川だんご屋)**

- **Location**: Midway along the shrine approach (near the Ni-no-torii gate).
- **Recommended Menu**: A must-stop for visitors! The **'Nori Dango,'** freshly grilled chewy rice cakes brushed with a savory soy sauce and wrapped in seaweed, is a delicacy you have to try. Paired with sweet red bean paste dango, it will melt your fatigue away.

#### **2. Omiya Park (大宮公園)**

- **Features**: A vast park that surrounds the shrine. It is a famous cherry blossom spot with 1,000 cherry trees blooming in spring, and there is also a small zoo with free admission, making it perfect for family outings.

#### **3. The Railway Museum**

- **Location**: A 20-minute walk from the shrine or by taking the New Shuttle.
- **Features**: If you love trains, this is a must-visit pilgrimage site! The overwhelming scale of the actual trains on display and the train driving simulator experience will bring out the child in everyone, young and old.
