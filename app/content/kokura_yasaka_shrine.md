Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

This is not just any shrine. It is a historic site founded by the great Sengoku-period warlord Hosokawa Tadaoki, and the birthplace of the 'Kokura Gion Daiko' drum festival, as thrilling as a scene from a movie. Here, where the tranquility of the castle walls and the passion of the festival coexist, come and encounter powerful protective energy and stories from history.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Powerful Guardian of the Castle

Before you pass through the red torii gate of Kokura Yasaka Shrine, first learn about the deity who resides here and the fascinating history behind it.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Susanoo-no-Mikoto】**

The main deity (主祭神) enshrined here is **Susanoo-no-Mikoto**.
He is the hero god from Japanese mythology who defeated the eight-headed, eight-tailed serpent monster, 'Yamata no Orochi.' With his immense power, he is revered as a deity of **'warding off evil (yakuyoke)'** and **'pestilence prevention.'**
Furthermore, thanks to his romance of marrying Kushinadahime after rescuing her from the monster, he is also known to be efficacious for **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'** and **'marital harmony.'** He is a charming deity who possesses both strength and tenderness.

#### **【Origins and History: A Place Imbued with the Wishes of Warlords】**

The shrine's history dates back to 1617. At that time, the lord of the Kokura domain, **Hosokawa Tadaoki**, relocated Gion-sha (the present-day Yasaka Shrine) into the castle grounds to serve as a guardian deity, praying for the safety of the castle and the town during its construction. Tadaoki was a renowned warrior skilled in both military and literary arts, and his deep faith laid the foundation for the shrine as it is today.

Later, during the Edo period, the Ogasawara clan worshipped the shrine for generations and gave birth to the **'Kokura Gion Daiko,'** one of Japan's three major Gion festivals. The drumbeats that echoed from within the castle were both a prayer for the well-being of the people and the very heartbeat that invigorated the city.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds (Keidai): A Mystical Space Within the Castle Walls

Kokura Yasaka Shrine is located within the Kokura Castle grounds, giving it a unique atmosphere. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **South Torii Gate and Stone Staircase**

This is the entrance to the shrine from the direction of Kokura Castle's keep. Passing through the massive stone torii and climbing the steep stone steps feels as though you are crossing over castle walls into a divine realm. The view from the top of the stairs, with the harmony of Kokura Castle's moat and the modern cityscape, is exquisitely beautiful.

#### **Haiden (Hall of Worship) and Honden (Main Hall)**

The Haiden in the center of the grounds is not ornate but has a simple elegance and dignity. Offer a sincere prayer in front of this wooden structure, rebuilt in 1934, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette. Behind the Haiden, the Honden, where the deity resides, is quietly situated.

#### **Kokura Gion Daiko Monument**

On one side of the grounds, there is a bronze statue depicting the dynamic act of drumming. Every July, the shrine fills with the excitement of the festival. You can almost hear the unique technique of striking both sides of the drum simultaneously and the powerful chant of "Yassa, yare yare!"

#### **The 400-Year-Old Castle Sugi (Sacred Tree)**

A portion of a 400-year-old cedar tree, which fell in a typhoon but is still preserved, can be found here. Touch this tree, which has shared its history with Kokura Castle, and pray for health and longevity.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Capturing the Power of the Drums

Here are some special items to help you cherish the memory of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Kokura Yasaka Shrine is powerful and neat. The bold calligraphy of **'八坂神社'** (Yasaka Jinja) in the center and the red seal feel as reassuring as a charm against misfortune. During the festival period, you might be able to receive a limited-edition goshuin featuring a drawing of a drum.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Gion Daiko Charm**: A cute charm shaped like a small drum or with a drumstick attached. It embodies the belief that the sound of drums drives away evil spirits, and is intended to **ward off evil** and **bring victory**. It's also popular as a souvenir.
- **Yakuyoke (Evil-Warding) Charm**: A representative charm imbued with the power of Susanoo. Recommended for those in an unlucky year or anyone wishing to break a streak of bad luck.
- **Enmusubi (Matchmaking) Charm**: A lovely charm for those hoping for a good match or relationship.
