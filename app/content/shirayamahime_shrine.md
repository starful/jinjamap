Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, we journey to the foothills of **'Mount Hakusan' (White Mountain)**, a sacred mountain (霊山) and one of Japan's three famous mountains. Located in Ishikawa Prefecture, **'Shirayamahime Shrine (白山比咩神社)'** is the head shrine of over 3,000 Hakusan shrines nationwide and a sacred place that has been a center of mountain worship since ancient times.

Here resides the legendary goddess **'Kukurihime,'** who dramatically reconciled the creator god couple after they had separated at the threshold of death. It is a place with the miraculous power to reconnect severed ties and resolve tangled relationships.
From the forest path guarded by an 800-year-old giant tree to the clear waterfall that cleanses the heart, we invite you to this healing forest that purifies the soul.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Mediator Who Stopped a Divine Couple's Quarrel

The story of Shirayamahime Shrine begins at one of the most tense moments in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Kukurihime-no-Kami】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Kukurihime-no-Kami (Shirayamahime)**. Just as her name suggests from the word 'kukuru' (to bind, to tie a knot), she is a goddess who connects people and brings harmony.
Enshrined alongside her are **Izanagi** and **Izanami**, the creator god couple who made Japan. The husband, who went to the underworld to find his deceased wife, fled upon seeing her hideous, decaying form, and the two became bitter enemies, hurling terrible curses at each other.

#### **【Origins and History: At the Boundary of Life and Death】**

It was at this critical moment, at 'Yomotsu Hirasaka,' the boundary between the land of the living and the dead, that Kukurihime appeared. When she whispered something to Izanagi, his rage melted away like snow, and he departed peacefully.
Thanks to this myth, Kukurihime came to be revered as the goddess of **'harmony,'** **'mediation,'** and **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'**. If you wish to mend relationships with a quarreling partner, an estranged family member, or a difficult coworker, this is the place to visit.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Millennium Forest Path and a Healing Waterfall

The shrine grounds are filled with the pure energy of Mount Hakusan. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Omotesando (Main Approach)**

Past the torii gate at the entrance, a forest path lined with towering cedar and cypress trees unfolds. Just walking while breathing in the phytoncides emitted by the centuries-old giant trees feels as if the knots in your heart are untangling.

#### **800-Year-Old Sacred Tree and Main Hall**

Next to the worship hall (Haiden) stands **'Oosugi,'** a giant cedar tree over 800 years old. Place your hands on this tree, with a circumference of 8 meters, and feel the life force of the earth. Behind it sits the main hall (Honden) with its elegantly curved roof.

#### **Hakurei-no-Taki (White Spirit Waterfall)**

In one corner of the grounds, clear water flowing from Mount Hakusan cascades down as a waterfall. Listening to the sound of this water, called **'sacred water (goshinsui),'** feels as if your heart is becoming transparent.

#### **Sazare-ishi (Pebble Rock)**

The **'Sazare-ishi'** mentioned in the Japanese national anthem can also be found here. Just as small pebbles gather to become a large boulder, it symbolizes harmony, bringing people's hearts together as one.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Tying and Guiding Connections

The items available at Shirayamahime Shrine carry meanings of 'connection' and 'guidance'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here is stamped with **'加賀國一宮 (Kaga no Kuni Ichinomiya),'** signifying its high rank as the primary shrine of the former Kaga Province. The simple yet powerful calligraphy makes it well worth collecting.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yoi-enmusubi (Good Matchmaking) Charm**: This charm, with its beautiful knot decoration, attracts not only romantic partners but all kinds of good relationships.
- **Michibiki (Guidance) Charm**: A charm to help you choose the right path at a crossroads in life. Recommended for those facing employment or academic decisions.
