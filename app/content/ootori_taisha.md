### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Hero Who Arrived as a White Bird

Behind the grandeur of a shrine, there is always a heart-stirring story. The protagonist of Ootori Taisha is a hero who lived one of the most dramatic lives in Japanese history.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Yamato Takeru no Mikoto】**

The main deity (主祭神) enshrined here is **Yamato Takeru no Mikoto**, the son of the 12th Emperor Keikō.
He was a legendary warrior who laid the foundations of Japan (the Yamato court) by pacifying rebellions in the east and west with his outstanding martial arts and strategy. However, his life was a continuous series of battles and hardships. Following his father's orders, he roamed the battlefields, ultimately dying in the distant land of Ise without ever returning home.

Thanks to his turbulent life, Ootori Taisha is revered as a god of **Winning Luck (勝運)**, **Good Fortune in Battle (武運長久)**, and **Protection from Evil (厄除け)**. In particular, his indomitable spirit of rising again after falling has become a powerful source of strength for those who dream of a **'comeback (再起)'** and **'revival (復活)'** today.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of Senboku-no-Mori (千樹の杜)】**

According to myth, when Yamato Takeru no Mikoto succumbed to illness, a **great white bird (白鳥)** rose from his body. This bird flew towards its homeland of Yamato and finally descended upon the lush forest here in Izumi Province. The people built a shrine on the spot where the bird rested to honor him, and this was the beginning of Ootori Taisha. That is why the forest here is called **'Senboku-no-Mori'**, meaning 'Forest of a Thousand Trees'.

Historically, this place was the highest-ranking shrine, or **'Ichinomiya (一宮)'**, in Izumi Province (present-day southern Osaka) and was deeply venerated by the imperial court and samurai warriors. Although it was burned down by Oda Nobunaga, it was rebuilt with the support of Toyotomi Hideyori and the Tokugawa shogunate, and its majesty endures to this day.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Walking in the Mythical Forest

As you step through the shrine entrance, the air changes so dramatically that you'll wonder if such a place could exist in the city. Take a walk along the sacred path, breathing in the phytoncides released by centuries-old giant trees.

#### **The Majesty of the Main Hall in Ootori-zukuri (大鳥造) Style**

The main hall, which you encounter at the end of the main path, is built in the **'Ootori-zukuri'** style, a very precious form in the history of Japanese shrine architecture. Along with the styles of Izumo Taisha and Sumiyoshi Taisha, it is one of the oldest architectural styles, characterized by its linear and simple yet powerful presence. The undecorated beauty of the natural wood seems to evoke the hero's spirit. Here, offer your prayers with sincerity—'two bows, two claps, one bow'—and fortify your resolve.

#### **The Healing Forest and Nenekusa Shrine**

'Senboku-no-Mori', which envelops the main hall, is a massive power spot in itself. Deeper within the forest, you will find the small but potent **'Nenekusa Shrine'**.
This place has long been associated with legends of curing intractable diseases and boils, and it continues to attract a steady stream of visitors praying for good health. It is especially sought out by those facing major surgery or battling cancer, due to the belief that it **'pulls the illness out from the root (根)'**. Try rubbing the affected area with a 'healing stone' from the shrine as you pray for a full recovery.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Rise Again Like a Roly-Poly Doll

The amulets and souvenirs at Ootori Taisha specialize in 'comeback' and 'victory'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here is grand and powerful. The seal stamped in the center, **'和泉国一之宮 (Izumi-no-kuni Ichinomiya)'**, certifies this place as the highest-ranking sacred site in southern Osaka. Absorb the hero's energy from the powerful strokes of the calligraphy.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Tatsu-mamori (起守)**: This is Ootori Taisha's signature amulet. The character for **'Rise (起)'** is written prominently, symbolizing the spirit of "fall down seven times, get up eight." It is the perfect gift for those starting over after a failure or for those wishing to recover from illness.
- **Kachi-mamori (勝守)**: An amulet that brings victory. It will be a reliable source of support for those facing exams or competitions.
- **Yatagarasu Omikuji**: A cute omikuji (paper fortune) in the shape of 'Yatagarasu', the divine crow guide of the gods. When you are lost at a crossroads in life, it will guide you to the right path.
