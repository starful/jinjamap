### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the gods enshrined there, the Go-saijin (御祭神), and the background of its founding. Within the small precincts of Koami Shrine, truly powerful and benevolent gods are seated, listening to the earnest wishes of those who visit.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

The following deities are enshrined at Koami Shrine.

- **Principal Deities (主祭神)**
  - **Ukanomitama-no-kami (倉稲魂神)**: The god of grains, symbolizing abundance and prosperity. Presiding over the five grains, this deity was widely known as a god of agriculture, but as times changed, became a deeply revered object of faith as a god who guides commercial success, business prosperity, and overall financial fortune. This is the main deity of Inari shrines, whom we commonly call 'Oinari-san (お稲荷さん)'.
  - **Ichikishimahime-no-kami (市杵島姫神)**: The goddess of water, arts, and wealth. She is better known as 'Benzaiten (弁財天)', who is identified with the Hindu goddess Saraswati, and is said to have great power in bringing financial luck and fostering relationships. She is also the central deity of the 'Zeniarai (銭洗い, money washing)' faith at Koami Shrine.
  - **Fukurokuju (福禄寿)**: One of the Seven Lucky Gods (七福神) who governs fortune (福), prosperity (禄), and longevity (寿), depicted as an old man with a gentle smile. He is an auspicious god who bestows blessings of flourishing descendants, wealth, and health and long life.

As such, Koami Shrine enshrines representative deities who govern wealth and fortune together, receiving absolute support from worshippers praying for increased financial and business luck.

#### **【Origins and History】**

The history of Koami Shrine dates back about 550 years to the Muromachi period. Its beginning stemmed from a story that was like a miracle.

In the year 1466 (the first year of the Bunsei era), a terrible plague ravaged this area, causing countless people to die in agony. As the villagers fell into despair, helpless, a figure named Eshin Sozu (恵心僧都) appeared in the dream of a man who was a sailor and fisherman. He delivered a divine message: *"Go out to the sea now and cast your net. My statue will be caught in it. If the villagers devotedly enshrine that statue morning and night, the plague will disappear."*

The next day, the fisherman, half in doubt, went out to sea and cast his net. Astonishingly, inside the net he pulled up were enshrined the divine statues of a radiant Benzaiten (Ichikishimahime-no-kami) and Inari Okami (Ukanomitama-no-kami). Following the oracle, he built a small hermitage (草庵) and enshrined the statues with great care. Then, as if by magic, the plague that had blanketed the village vanished in an instant.

This miraculous story spread quickly, and people began to call the small shrine **'Koami (小網)'**, meaning 'small net'. This is the origin story of Koami Shrine's founding.

The miracles of Koami Shrine did not stop there. Even in modern history, the sacred power of the shrine has been proven several times.

- **The Miracle of the Great Kanto Earthquake**: In 1923, when the Great Kanto Earthquake turned Tokyo to ashes, all the surrounding buildings were engulfed in flames and collapsed. But miraculously, only the shrine building of Koami Shrine escaped the blaze and remained intact. It is said that the palace carpenters who were rebuilding the shrine at the time worked desperately to protect it and were able to survive thanks to the divine protection of the gods. The current shrine hall and worship hall were built at this time and are living witnesses of history that have overcome war and disaster.

- **The Miracle of the Tokyo Air Raids**: At the end of World War II, Tokyo became a sea of fire due to large-scale air raids by the US military. The Nihonbashi area was also devastated, but the area where Koami Shrine is located strangely escaped damage. The story of soldiers who went to war carrying the shrine's amulets (お守り) and all returned safely is very famous. As this story spread, Koami Shrine firmly established its reputation as a shrine of **'Goun-yakuyoke (強運厄除)'**, which wards off disasters and protects lives.

Thus, the history of Koami Shrine, which has staunchly survived the great disasters of plague, earthquake, and war, makes one feel that it is imbued with a powerful divine protection that goes beyond mere coincidence. The intense life force and hopeful energy emanating from this small shrine are precisely why so many people visit this place.

### 2. A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

Koami Shrine is a place where sacred energy is condensed within its cozy precincts. As you walk through the grounds following the order of worship, I hope you feel the meaning and blessings imbued in each spot with your whole body.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden)・Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

After passing through the torii gate and entering the precincts, the first thing that catches your eye is the Haiden (Worship Hall) located directly in front. Although this wooden building, which survived the flames of the Great Kanto Earthquake, is small in size, the intricacy and dignity of its carvings are overwhelming.

Particularly noteworthy are the carvings of the **'Ascending Dragon (昇り龍)' and 'Descending Dragon (降り龍)'** under the roof. The 'Ascending Dragon', which conveys the worshippers' wishes to the gods, and the 'Descending Dragon', which bestows the gods' virtues upon the worshippers, are representative symbols of Koami Shrine, symbolizing the blessings of Goun-yakuyoke. The dynamic appearance and delicate expression of the dragons are works of art created by the best palace carpenters of the time, and simply pausing to feel their energy seems to grant great strength.

Worship is conducted according to the 'Nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (two bows, two claps, one bow) etiquette.

1. Quietly place your offering (お賽銭, osaisen) into the offering box.
2. Bow deeply from the waist twice (二礼, nirei).
3. Clap your hands twice at chest height (二拍手, nihakushu).
4. Put your hands together and pray earnestly.
5. Finally, bow deeply from the waist once more (一礼, ichirei).

Here, express your respect for the gods and convey the deep wishes of your heart.

#### **【Tokyo Zeniarai Benten (東京銭洗い弁天)】**

To the left of the Haiden is the 'Tokyo Zeniarai Benten', one of the most popular power spots at Koami Shrine. Here, sacred water called the **'Well of Manpuku (万福の井)'** (Well of Ten Thousand Fortunes) gushes forth, and it is said that washing money in this water will multiply one's financial luck several times over.

1. Place coins or bills in the baskets (ざる, zaru) provided in the precincts.
2. Carefully wash the money with the water flowing from the 'Well of Manpuku'.
3. Wipe the money dry with a clean handkerchief.
4. It is said that if you keep this purified money (種銭, Tane-zeni, or seed money) in your wallet without using it right away, it will attract other money.

This ritual is more than just an act of praying for wealth; it carries the meaning of washing away the negative energy attached to money and vowing to welcome wealth with a pure heart. The sight of many people washing their money with serious expressions is an impressive scene in itself.

#### **【Statue of Fukurokuju (福禄寿)】**

Right next to the Zeniarai Benten, a statue of Fukurokuju, one of the Seven Lucky Gods, greets worshippers with a gentle smile. This statue, which is also part of the 'Nihonbashi Seven Lucky Gods Pilgrimage (日本橋七福神めぐり)', is known as the god of health and longevity, virtue, and financial fortune.

Gently stroke the statue's head to pray for health and longevity, and touch its body to pray for good fortune. The statue, polished smooth by the hands of countless people over many years, seems to exude its divine power.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Juyohin: Proof of Your Visit

After finishing your worship, receiving a Goshuin (御朱印) as proof or an Omamori (お守り) containing the divine protection of the gods is another great pleasure of a shrine pilgrimage. Koami Shrine has many special items befitting its reputation.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive two types of Goshuin at Koami Shrine.

- **Koami Shrine Goshuin**: '小網神社 (Koami Jinja)' is powerfully written in the center with ink, and a red seal with **'強運厄除 (Goun-yakuyoke)'** is stamped on the right, showing the shrine's blessings at a glance.
- **Benzaiten Goshuin**: '辨財天 (Benzaiten)' is written in the center, and the **'東京銭洗い弁天 (Tokyo Zeniarai Benten)'** seal is stamped alongside it, making it particularly popular among those wishing for increased financial luck.

Both Goshuin feature calligraphy that is both elegant and powerful, and they will become a precious memento of your visit. Limited edition Goshuin may be available during special periods, so it is recommended to check the official website before your visit.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

Koami Shrine offers a wide variety of unique and effective Omamori, making the selection process enjoyable.

- **Mayudama Mikuji (まゆ玉みくじ)**: A unique form of fortune slip (おみくじ, omikuji) where the paper fortune is inside a real silkworm cocoon. Just as a silkworm spins thread to make a cocoon, it holds the meaning of strongly pulling the threads of good relationships and luck. Its round, cute shape makes it a popular souvenir.
- **Mimizuku (みみずく, Owl) Charm**: An owl-shaped charm containing the blessings of 'Goun-yakuyoke'. In Japan, the owl is considered an auspicious animal because its name, 'fukurou', is a pun for 'no hardship' (不苦労) and 'fortune comes' (福来郎).
- **Zeniarai no Kame (銭洗いの龜) Charm**: A small metal turtle-shaped charm containing the blessings of the Zeniarai Benten. It is said to increase financial luck when kept in a wallet.
- **Yubiwamamori (指輪守, Ring Charm)**: A small ring-shaped charm that is popular because it can always be worn to receive divine protection. It is said to ward off evil and bring good relationships.

In addition to these, there are various other types of Omamori, so take your time to carefully choose the one that matches your wish and cherish it.

- **Signature dish**: The Oyakodon, with its rich and deep-flavored broth, tender chicken, and perfectly soft-boiled egg, boasts a superb taste that makes the wait worthwhile. If you want a special lunch after visiting Koami Shrine, this would be the best choice.
