Hello, this is your 'JinjaMap' editor, traveling to beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **'Heian Jingu (平安神宮)'**, a place welcomed by the iconic red torii gate of Kyoto. In the ancient capital of Kyoto, where countless shrines have stood for a thousand years, Heian Jingu is relatively young, built in 1895. However, it embodies the fervent pride of Kyoto's citizens and their desire for revival.

It was created by the collective effort of its citizens to revitalize Kyoto, which was in decline after the emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration. Shall we now journey to this place, with its overwhelmingly grand architecture recreating the Heian period Imperial Palace and its secret garden, 'Shin-en', where flowers bloom through all four seasons?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Enshrining the Beginning and End of Kyoto

Behind the grandeur of Heian Jingu lies the story of two emperors who bookend Kyoto's history.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Emperor Kanmu and Emperor Komei】**

This shrine is dedicated to the **50th Emperor Kanmu** and the **121st Emperor Komei**.

- **Emperor Kanmu**: In 794, he moved the capital from Nara to Kyoto (Heian-kyo), laying the foundation for the thousand-year capital. He symbolizes the **'beginning'** of Kyoto and is revered as a deity who brings **good fortune (kaiun)** and helps with **new beginnings**.
- **Emperor Komei**: He was the last emperor to be enthroned in Kyoto. A figure who dedicated himself to the nation's peace during the turbulent end of the shogunate, he symbolizes the **'end'** of imperial Kyoto and is believed to grant blessings for **peace** and **matchmaking**.

#### **【Origin and History: Glory Revived by the Power of the People】**

The year 1895 marked the 1100th anniversary of Kyoto becoming the capital. At the time, Kyoto was losing its vitality after the emperor's departure. Feeling a sense of crisis, the citizens of Kyoto organized an exposition to revive the city and founded Heian Jingu as its centerpiece.
This shrine, a 5/8 scale replica of the **'Chodo-in' (朝堂院)**, the center of government during the Heian period, is a monumental place embodying the citizens' determination to revive Kyoto's past glory and move toward the future.

### 2. ⛩️ A Walk Through the Precincts: The Vermilion Palace and the Divine Garden

The moment you step into the precincts, you'll feel as if you've traveled back in time to the Heian period. Here are the must-see points.

#### **O-torii and Otenmon Gate**

The giant red torii gate that straddles the road in front of the shrine stands at an impressive 24.4 meters. Passing through this gate, you'll see the majestic two-story **'Otenmon Gate' (応天門)**. The harmony of its blue tiles and vermilion pillars is the epitome of splendor.

#### **Daigokuden (大極殿)**

Beyond the Otenmon Gate, a vast white gravel courtyard unfolds, with the **'Daigokuden'** standing at its end. This was the main hall where important state ceremonies were held, flanked by towers symbolizing the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger. Offer your prayers at the front hall (Haiden) with the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' ritual and absorb its majestic energy.

#### **The Secret Garden, Shin-en (神苑)**

The highlight of Heian Jingu! This is a vast garden of approximately 33,000 square meters that envelops the area behind the main shrine buildings.

- **Spring**: It is a prime cherry blossom spot, famous for its weeping red cherry trees in full bloom.
- **Summer**: The pond is filled with irises and water lilies, showing off their pure beauty.
- **Autumn & Winter**: The serene scenery created by autumn leaves and snowscapes brings peace to the mind.
  In particular, the view from the **'Taihei-kaku'** bridge, which crosses the pond in the East Garden (Higashi Shin-en), offers an unforgettable, moving experience. (Separate admission fee required)

Heian Jingu is the pride of the thousand-year capital of Kyoto and a miraculous space preserved through the love of its citizens.
Walk among the vermilion pillars and imagine the elegance of the ancient nobility, and listen to the sound of flowing water in the tranquil Shin-en Garden.

Heian Jingu is where past glory and present tranquility coexist. I hope you find your own special 'peace' (平安) there.
