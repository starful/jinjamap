Just a step away from the hustle and bustle of Asakusa, in the heart of Tokyo, you'll find a special place where time seems to stand still, weaving countless threads of fate. This is **Imado Shrine (今戸神社)**, known for its powerful 'Enmusubi' (縁結び, matchmaking) energy.

Going beyond simple romantic fulfillment, this shrine blesses all precious connections between people, exuding a unique charm that blends the grand narrative of Japanese mythology with the simple faith of common people. Notably, it is also famous as the **birthplace of the Maneki-neko (招き猫)**, the beckoning cat that brings good fortune.

Today, we will open the gates of Imado Shrine, welcomed by its cute cats, and embark on a sacred pilgrimage following the deep stories and divine energy enshrined within.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the gods enshrined there, the *Gosaishin* (御祭神).

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

The main deities of Imado Shrine are the divine couple who adorn the first pages of Japanese mythology, **Izanagi-no-Mikoto (伊弉諾尊)** and **Izanami-no-Mikoto (伊弉冉尊)**.

- **Izanagi & Izanami**: They are the first married couple in mythology, who gave birth to the islands of Japan and numerous other gods. As Imado Shrine enshrines them, it is believed to have a deeper and more powerful effect on 'Enmusubi'—tying and protecting relationships, including marital harmony and romantic success—than any other shrine.

Imado Shrine also enshrines the following deities:

- **Emperor Ōjin (応神天皇)**: He is identified with Hachiman-shin (八幡神), the god of martial arts and success. He is a reliable guardian deity who guides people to victory on the battlefield of life and helps them achieve their goals.
- **Fukurokuju (福禄寿)**: As one of the Seven Lucky Gods of Asakusa (七福神), he governs happiness (福), wealth (禄), and longevity (寿). He bestows these three great blessings, enriching and watching over one's entire life.

#### **【Origins and History: The Birth of the Maneki-neko】**

The history of Imado Shrine dates back to 1063. It began when the warrior Minamoto no Yoriyoshi and his son enshrined the Hachiman deity from Kyoto to pray for victory in battle. Later, in 1937, it merged with the nearby Hakusan Shrine (which enshrined Izanagi and Izanami) to become the shrine it is today.

However, what makes Imado Shrine even more special is the legend of it being the **birthplace of the Maneki-neko**.

In the late Edo period, a poor old woman lived in the Imado area. She was so poor that she had to part with her beloved cat. The cat then appeared in her dream and said, "Create my image out of clay, and fortune will come to you." The cat figurines she made became immensely popular, and the old woman was able to escape poverty. As this story spread, Imado Shrine became established as a sacred place that brings good relationships and wealth through the Maneki-neko.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The grounds of Imado Shrine are compact, but every step is filled with lovely sights where you can feel the energy of Enmusubi and good fortune.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

As you step further into the grounds, the worship hall (Haiden) at the front greets visitors. Peeking inside, you'll see a giant pair of Maneki-neko welcoming you with gentle smiles. On the left is a cat with its left paw raised (beckoning people), and on the right is a cat with its right paw raised (beckoning money), seeming to promise both good relationships and financial luck.

Worship here follows the **'Nirei Nihakushu Ichirei' (二礼二拍手一礼)** etiquette (two bows, two claps, one bow). When you clap, silently state your name and address to the gods and respectfully convey your wish for a desired relationship.

#### **【Ishhinade Neko (石なで猫) - The Stone-Petting Cats】**

Right next to the worship hall is the **'Ishhinade Neko'**, said to be Imado Shrine's greatest power spot. The name means 'stone-petting cats,' and it is a pair of cat statues sitting side by side.

There is a special way to pray to these cats:

1. Gently stroke the cat statues.
2. Take a picture of the cats with your smartphone.
3. Set the photo as your smartphone's wallpaper.

A strong belief has been passed down that doing this will make your wishes come true and bring good fortune in relationships. If you visit, be sure to perform this special ritual to receive a boost of luck.

#### **【Enmusubi Ema (縁結び絵馬) - Matchmaking Votive Plaques】**

The *ema* (votive plaques) at Imado Shrine have a unique **circular (円形)** shape. This symbolizes 'smooth, well-rounded relationships' and 'connections (縁, *en*)'. The cute pair of Maneki-neko along with the characters for 'Enmusubi' will warm your heart just by looking at them. Hang your own heart's desire on the 'wish tree' alongside the countless earnest prayers of others.

#### **【Asakusa's Seven Lucky Gods: Fukurokuju (福禄寿)】**

In a corner of the grounds, there is a small shrine dedicated to **Fukurokuju**, part of the Asakusa Seven Lucky Gods pilgrimage. In addition to praying for relationships, you can also pray here for prosperity and well-being in all aspects of life: happiness, wealth, and longevity.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Offerings (授与品): A Proof of Your Visit

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The *goshuin* (shrine seal) of Imado Shrine is particularly popular among visitors. Its most prominent feature is the **red stamp depicting a pair of Maneki-neko**, the symbol of the shrine. This adorable stamp adds warmth and vitality to the goshuin. You can also receive limited-edition goshuin on special days like Cat Day (February 22).

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物) - Amulets & Lucky Charms】**

- **Enmusubi Omamori (縁結御守)**: Like the ema, this is a circular amulet. The round shape signifies a harmonious relationship, and the Maneki-neko will help draw that connection to you.
- **Kagami Mamori (鏡守り)**: A unique amulet in the form of a small hand mirror. It is meant to reflect away bad energy and help you reflect on your inner self, preparing you to welcome a good relationship.
- **Maneki-neko Omikuji**: A small ceramic Maneki-neko containing a fortune slip (*omikuji*). It’s two-in-one: the fun of fortune-telling and a cute souvenir.
