Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll guide you to the quiet rural town of Usa City (宇佐市) in Oita Prefecture, Kyushu. This is the home of **'Usa Jingu (宇佐神宮)'**, the head shrine and pinnacle of the staggering 44,000 'Hachiman shrines (Hachimangu)' spread across Japan.

It is a highly revered place, second only to Ise Grand Shrine in imperial worship, and a historic site where crucial oracles were delivered at times that decided the nation's fate since ancient times. It boasts a unique architectural style designated as a National Treasure, a massive 800-year-old camphor tree, and a powerful aura that summons victory.

Shall we embark on a special pilgrimage together, one that goes beyond a simple visit and into the very heart of Japanese history?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The God of Victory and the Oracle that Changed History

Usa Jingu is one of the great roots of Japanese faith. The stories intertwined with this place are like a historical drama.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Hachiman-ōkami】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Hachiman-ōkami (Emperor Ōjin)**.
He is the deified spirit of the 15th Emperor Ōjin, a sage ruler who brought culture to flourish in ancient Japan, and is revered as the **'God of Martial Arts'** and the **'God of Victory'**. Since ancient times, samurai would pray here for certain victory before heading to battle, and today, it continues to attract people praying for success in exams, sports competitions, and business.
Enshrined alongside him are **Hime-ōkami (three goddesses)**, who oversee traffic safety and wealth, and **Empress Jingū (Emperor Ōjin's mother)**, who governs safe childbirth and child-rearing.

#### **【Origin and History: The Oracle that Protected the Imperial Family】**

The history of Usa Jingu dates back to 725. However, what made this place legendary was the **'Usa Hachiman Oracle Incident'** of 769.
When the monk Dōkyō attempted to usurp the imperial throne, the court sent an imperial envoy, Wake no Kiyomaro, to this shrine to ask for the deity's will. At that time, the Hachiman deity delivered a stern oracle: "Never has a subject become a sovereign. Banish the lawless one." This protected the legitimacy of the imperial line. After this incident, Usa Jingu gained absolute authority as a **'Guardian Deity of the Nation'**.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: Unique Architecture and Four Claps

From its worship etiquette to its architectural style, Usa Jingu is full of unique characteristics that set it apart from other shrines.

#### **Jōgū, Gegū, and 'Two Bows, Four Claps, One Bow'**

The precincts are divided into the **Jōgū (Upper Shrine, the main sanctuary)** on the hill and the **Gegū (Lower Shrine)** at its base. There's a saying, "A visit is only half complete without praying at the Gegū," so be sure to visit both.
And here's the most important tip! The worship etiquette at Usa Jingu is not the usual 'two claps' but **'four claps (two bows, four claps, one bow)'**. This is a formal ritual practiced only at a very few highly revered shrines, such as Ise Grand Shrine and Usa Jingu. Offer your deep reverence with four claps.

#### **National Treasure Hachiman-zukuri (八幡造) Main Hall**

The main hall in the Jōgū is a treasure of Japanese architectural history, a **National Treasure**. It is the origin of the unique **'Hachiman-zukuri'** style, where two buildings are connected front to back. It's said the deity resides in the front building (Ge-den) during the day and the rear building (Nai-den) at night, showcasing an intricate design that even considers the deity's bedchamber. The vermilion lacquer and ornate decorations shine even brighter amidst the forest.

#### **Power Spots: The Couple Stones and the 800-Year-Old Camphor Tree**

- **Meoto Iwa (Couple Stones)**: On the stone steps leading to the Jōgū, two triangular stones are embedded side by side. It is said that if you are alone, you should step on them with both feet, and if you are a couple, you should hold hands and each step on one stone for your love to be fulfilled.
- **Giant Camphor Tree (Sacred Tree)**: Next to the Jōgū's main hall stands a massive camphor tree, over 800 years old with a circumference of more than 5 meters. Walk around the tree once while making a wish, or touch the tree to feel its life force. It is a famous healing spot.

#### **Omotesando Shopping Street**

After your visit, enjoy the flavors of Oita at the shopping street in front of the shrine. **'Toriten (chicken tempura)'** or **'Negiyaki (scallion pancakes)'** are perfect for satisfying your hunger.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Embracing the Arrow of Victory

The amulets and souvenirs from Usa Jingu carry a strong and powerful energy.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Usa Jingu features the characters **'豊前國一之宮 (Buzen no Kuni Ichinomiya)'**, meaning 'The First Shrine of Buzen Province,' along with the shrine's vermilion seal. The calligraphy is simple yet powerfully written. You can receive it at both the Jōgū and the Gegū.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Kachimamori (Victory Amulet)**: Befitting a Hachimangu shrine, the god of competition, this is the most popular amulet. It provides strength for all moments when you 'want to win,' such as exams, competitions, or business ventures.
- **Hatomamori (Dove Amulet)**: The dove is the messenger of the Hachiman deity. This cute dove-shaped amulet, said to bring peace and happiness, also makes a great gift.
- **Once-in-a-Lifetime Wish Amulet**: There is also a special amulet said to grant one earnest wish of a lifetime.
