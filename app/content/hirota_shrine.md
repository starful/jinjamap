  and Azalea Blessings of Hyogo''s Hirota Shrine'
---

Hello, readers! This is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' introducing you to unique shrines across Japan.

Today, I'll guide you to Nishinomiya City in Hyogo Prefecture, a quiet residential area just a 20-minute train ride from Osaka. Seemingly peaceful, this city's forest conceals a special shrine where immense power that shook Japan's history and an energy of victory lie dormant. It is **'Hirota Shrine (廣田神社)'**, one of the oldest shrines in Japan and considered the most ancient in Hyogo Prefecture.

This is not just a religious site. It's a place of profound history, personally founded by the heroic Empress Jingū of Japan's foundation myth, and it's a **'sacred site of victory'** where the entire 'Hanshin Tigers' baseball team comes to pray for victory before the start of each season. It also offers a stunning spring vista, embracing a colony of 20,000 azaleas that paint the mountain red in April.

Are you at a crucial turning point in your life? Or are you hesitating before an obstacle you must overcome? If so, let's embark on a pilgrimage with me to receive the powerful energy of the 'Aramitama' at Hirota Shrine.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Fierce Spirit that Leads to Victory

To understand why Hirota Shrine is called the 'Shrine of Victory,' one must deeply understand the unique character of the deity enshrined here. The secret lies within the deity's name.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Amaterasu's Aramitama】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Amaterasu Ōmikami no Aramitama (天照大御神荒御魂)**.
Amaterasu, the sun goddess and supreme deity of Japan, is usually depicted as the gentle and peaceful 'Nigimitama (和御魂)'. However, Hirota Shrine enshrines her **'Aramitama (荒御魂)'**—her rough, valiant, and active spirit.

In Shinto (神道), 'Aramitama' does not simply mean violent. It symbolizes the **powerful force and energy** to pioneer new ventures, defeat enemies, and boldly break through to turn a situation around. That is why Hirota Shrine has been renowned since ancient times for its outstanding blessings in victory in war, national prosperity, and for individuals, **winning luck (勝運), good fortune (開運), and protection from evil (厄除け)**. This is why countless sports teams, students taking exams, and entrepreneurs starting new businesses come here to pray today.

#### **【Origin and History: The Land Chosen by a God】**

The history of Hirota Shrine dates back to 201 AD, to the age of myths. Its authority is so high that its founding is clearly recorded in the *Nihon Shoki*, one of Japan's official historical texts.

The story goes back to the legendary heroine Empress Jingū returning to Japan after her conquest of the Three Korean Kingdoms. When her ship reached the seas off Naniwa (Osaka), a strange event occurred: the boat began to spin in place, unable to move forward. The Empress performed divination, and the Aramitama of Amaterasu appeared, delivering an oracle.

**"My spirit wishes to reside in this land of Hirota (廣田), not far from the Imperial Court."**

Empress Jingū immediately ordered her aide, Yamato no Himeko, to build a shrine here and enshrine the deity, marking the beginning of Hirota Shrine. Later, during the Heian period, it was a highly prestigious shrine, counted among the 'Nijūnisha' (22 Shrines) where the Imperial Court directly offered prayers. For over a thousand years, it has stood at the center of Japanese history, protecting the nation's peace and victory.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Sacred Forest and a Feast of Azaleas

A dense forest, hard to believe it's in the middle of a city, envelops the shrine. Here are some of the special sights you can encounter while paying your respects.

#### **The Majestic Haiden and Honden: The Aesthetics of Shinmei-zukuri**

The *haiden* (worship hall) you encounter after passing through the *sandō* (approach) was rebuilt in 2001, but it fully captures the beauty of traditional shrine architecture. The *honden* (main sanctuary) behind it is built in the **'Shinmei-zukuri (神明造)'** style, the same as Ise Grand Shrine. Its linear design devoid of ornamentation, thatched roof, and soaring pillars exude a simple yet unapproachable, absolute dignity. Offer your prayers here with 'two bows, two claps, and one bow' to cast off your inner hesitation and gain courage.

#### **A Colony of 20,000 Azaleas: The Garden of the Gods**

Another nickname for Hirota Shrine is the **'Shrine of Azaleas'**. Within the precincts and on Mount Hirota behind the shrine, there is a colony of a type of azalea called **'Kobanomitsuba Tsutsuji'**, designated as a Natural Monument of Hyogo Prefecture. Their number reaches a staggering 20,000.
Every year in mid-April, the sacred forest is dyed in a blazing crimson. This brilliant spectacle, arriving after the cherry blossoms have fallen, offers an overwhelming beauty, like a victor's crown bestowed by the gods. If you visit during this time, I highly recommend taking a walk along the trails.

#### **Sazare-ishi (さざれ石): Eternal Unity**

Next to the *haiden*, please take note of a rock placed in a less conspicuous spot. This is the **'Sazare-ishi (pebbles)'** mentioned in the lyrics of Japan's national anthem, 'Kimigayo.' The sight of small pebbles binding together over long years to form a single large boulder symbolizes 'unity,' 'prosperity,' and 'eternity.' It is a power spot that quietly bestows strength upon athletes needing team cohesion or those wishing for family harmony.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Keep a Token of Victory

The items offered at Hirota Shrine specialize in 'victory' and 'opening up good fortune.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The *goshuin* of Hirota Shrine is clean, simple, and powerful. The characters for **'廣田神社 (Hirota Jinja)'** written in bold calligraphy in the center evoke a sense of reliability just by looking at them. During the azalea season, you can receive a limited-edition *goshuin* stamped with a purple azalea seal, so collectors should time their visit accordingly.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Kachimamori (Victory Charm)**: This is the shrine's signature item. This charm, said to be carried by the Hanshin Tigers players themselves, instills the energy to win in all of life's competitions, including sports, exams, job hunting, and business.
- **Michihiraki (Path-Opening Charm)**: A charm to break through deadlocks and open new paths. It is recommended for those facing new challenges like a career change or starting a business.
- **Azalea Charm**: This charm, featuring beautiful azalea embroidery, is popular among women and is believed to protect good relationships and beauty.

Nishinomiya, where Hirota Shrine is located, is a city full of attractions. Here are some recommended spots to visit after your shrine visit.

#### **1. Hanshin Koshien Stadium (阪神甲子園球場)**

- **Distance**: About 15-20 minutes by bus.
- **Features**: The mecca of Japanese baseball and the home stadium of the Hanshin Tigers. Praying for victory at Hirota Shrine and then visiting Koshien, the very site where that energy explodes, is the perfect pilgrimage for baseball fans. On non-game days, you can visit the 'Koshien Museum of History' to feel the passion of Japanese baseball.

#### **2. Shukugawa Park (夙川公園)**

- **Distance**: About a 20-minute walk.
- **Features**: A beautiful riverside park selected as one of 'Japan's Top 100 Cherry Blossom Spots.' Over 1,600 cherry trees form a tunnel along a 2.8 km stretch. It's perfect for a stroll with beautiful cherry blossoms in spring and autumn leaves in the fall. Enjoying the azaleas of Hirota Shrine and the cherry blossoms of Shukugawa Park together would be the ultimate spring luxury.

#### **3. Nishinomiya Shrine (西宮神社)**

- **Distance**: About 20 minutes by train/bus.
- **Features**: The head shrine of the three great Ebisu shrines in Japan. If Hirota Shrine is for 'victory,' this one is for the god of 'business prosperity.' It is famous for the 'Fukuotoko' (Lucky Man) selection race held every January, where participants race to the main hall. Visiting both shrines to gather both winning luck and financial fortune is also a great idea.
