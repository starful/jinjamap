Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' where we explore sacred and mystical sites around the world.

Today, I'll guide you to a small fishing village at the eastern tip of Shimane Prefecture, the home of Japanese mythology. Here, filled with the scent of the sea, lies **'Miho Shrine (美保神社)'**, the head shrine of the deity we commonly call 'the god of fortune,' 'Ebisu-sama.'

This is not simply a place to pray for wealth. It is a site where the great decision of a protagonist from the dramatic "land transfer" (Kuniyuzuri) in Izumo mythology was made, and a space where a romantic god who loves music and the arts resides.

If you only visit Izumo Taisha, your journey is half-complete! Only by meeting both the "father god," Ōkuninushi of Izumo Taisha, and the "son god," Ebisu-sama (Kotoshironushi) of Miho Shrine, can you truly achieve a complete connection. Now, shall we journey together to this mythical sea, where the sound of waves beckons?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: The Son Who Yielded a Nation Becomes a God of Abundance

To understand the depth of Miho Shrine, it is essential to comprehend the special relationship and myth of the two deities enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Harmony of Mother and Son】**

Two deities are enshrined here.

- **Mihotsuhime-no-mikoto**: The wife of Ōkuninushi (the main deity of Izumo Taisha) and the goddess of agriculture. She is a benevolent mother goddess who governs the abundance of the five grains and the prosperity of descendants.
- **Kotoshironushi-no-kami (Ebisu-sama)**: The son of Ōkuninushi, and the very same 'Ebisu-sama' we know well, holding a fishing rod and a sea bream. He is worshipped nationwide as the god of **fisheries, maritime safety, and business prosperity**. He is also the god of arts who loves **music and dance**.

Because these two deities are together, Miho Shrine is an all-purpose power spot where one can receive blessings for **family harmony**, **business success**, and **artistic inspiration**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Moment of a Great Decision】**

According to mythology, when the heavenly gods (led by Amaterasu) demanded that Ōkuninushi, the ruler of the terrestrial world, hand over the land, Ōkuninushi entrusted the decision to his son, Kotoshironushi.
At that time, Kotoshironushi, who was enjoying fishing in the sea off Mihonoseki, replied without hesitation, "It is right to offer this land to the descendants of the heavenly gods." He then overturned the boat he was on and hid himself within it.

Thanks to this sacrificial decision, a peaceful transfer of power occurred without war, and he became a symbol of keeping divine promises and a guardian of peace. Miho Shrine is the sacred site built on the very stage of this historic myth.

### 2. 🌊 Strolling the Precincts: A Sacred Realm of Sea and Music

Miho Shrine faces the sea, so the sound of waves can be heard from anywhere on the grounds. Experience the unique atmosphere of this place.

#### **Unique Architecture: Miho-zukuri (美保造)**

If you look closely at the main hall (Honden), you will see a unique shape, as if two buildings are standing side-by-side with their arms around each other's shoulders. This is the only example in Japan of the **'Miho-zukuri'** style, with two connected sanctuaries enshrining Mihotsuhime (the mother) on the right and Kotoshironushi (the son) on the left. It exudes a sense of tranquility, like the image of a close mother and son.

#### **The Morning Ritual: Asamikesai (朝御饌祭)**

Every morning at 8:30 AM, a ritual is held where priests offer a meal to the deities. At this time, you can watch the elegant dance of the shrine maidens (miko) and listen to traditional musical instruments for free. The sound of the flute and drums cutting through the quiet morning air is a moving experience that seems to cleanse the soul. It's a privilege only early-rising travelers can enjoy!

#### **The Corridor and the Sea**

The corridor in front of the main hall is open on all sides, allowing the cool sea breeze to pass through. On days when raindrops fall, the ensemble of the sound of rain dripping from the eaves and the sound of the waves is truly music performed by nature. Perhaps this is the favorite sound of Ebisu-sama, the god of music?

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Sacred Items: Lucky Charms to Fish for Abundance

The sacred items (Juyohin) of Miho Shrine are filled with the 'good fortune' of Ebisu-sama.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here is simple yet powerful. The name of the shrine is written in the center with a vigorous brushstroke, and the red seal features Ebisu-sama's symbols: a **'sea bream'** and a **'fishing hook'**. Just looking at it makes you feel the joy of a great catch.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono】**

- **Lucky Sea Bream (Wooden Doll)**: A cute sea bream-shaped ornament. It is the most popular item, said to bring financial luck and fortune when placed at home.
- **Fishing Rod Charm**: This charm carries the meaning of fishing for great fortune. It is recommended for those facing business deals or important contracts.
- **Wish-Fulfilling 10-Yen Coin**: You can receive a gold-plated 10-yen coin from the shrine office (free of charge). It's a type of "seed money" that is said to attract more money if you keep it in your wallet. (It's even better if you come back a year later to return it with gratitude!)

### 4. 🏘️ Nearby Attractions: Blue Cobblestone Streets and Fresh Seafood

In front of the shrine, there is a street that retains the atmosphere of the Edo period.

#### **1. Aoishidatami-dōri (Blue Cobblestone Street)**

- **Location**: Right in front of the shrine.
- **Features**: A charming street paved with stones that are said to shine blue when it rains. Lined with old ryokans and soy sauce shops, it's perfect for taking photos. Enjoy the dreamlike atmosphere, as if you've traveled back in time.

#### **2. Mihonoseki Lighthouse**

- **Location**: A 5-minute drive away.
- **Features**: A short walk along a promenade leads to the expansive Sea of Japan and a white lighthouse. On a clear day, you can see as far as the Oki Islands.

#### **3. Local Cuisine: Squid Sashimi Bowl and Soy Sauce Ice Cream**

- **Recommendation**: As a port town, the seafood is incredibly fresh. The squid sashimi bowl (ika-don) is particularly exquisite, with a chewy and sweet flavor. For dessert, I recommend the sweet and savory **'soy sauce ice cream'** made by an old brewery.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Miho Shrine is often overshadowed by the fame of Izumo Taisha, but once you visit, you will be completely captivated by its serene and mystical charm.
A journey where you ask the father god (at Izumo Taisha) for a connection, and then ask the son god (at Miho Shrine) for the wisdom and abundance to nurture that connection. Isn't this the true completion of a trip to Shimane?

At this divine harbor where the sound of waves echoes, I hope you will pre-emptively fish for the joy of a full catch (満船) that will come into your life.
