title: 'Sever Bad Ties, Forge Good Ones: A New Beginning at Kyoto''s Yasui Konpiragu
  Shrine'
---

Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap', a journey to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a special shrine nestled between the splendid Gion district and the tranquil temples of Kyoto—a place that is small yet radiates a powerful energy. Picture a massive stone monument covered in so many paper charms (katashiro) that it resembles a giant, furry monster, with people crawling through a hole at its base.

This is **'Yasui Konpiragu (安井金比羅宮)'**. It is known as Japan's most powerful shrine for **'Enkiri (severing bad ties)'** and, at the same time, a sacred place to pray for new **'Enmusubi (tying good knots)'**.

Do you wish to part with bad relationships, illnesses, or harmful habits? Borrow the power of a tragic emperor's legend and this peculiar stone to start a new chapter in your life.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Aesthetics of Severance Left by an Unfortunate Emperor

The immense power of Yasui Konpiragu stems from the sorrowful history of an emperor.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Emperor Sutoku】**

The main deity (主祭神) enshrined here is the 75th **Emperor Sutoku**.
Caught in a power struggle, he was unjustly exiled and met a tragic end, becoming known as one of Japan's three great vengeful spirits (Onryō). Here, however, he is worshipped as a **deity who severs bad ties**, honoring the vow he made in exile to "cut off all worldly desires and attachments."
Enshrined alongside him is **Omononushi-no-kami**, a god of the sea and relationships, who fills the void left by severed ties with new, positive connections.

#### **【Origin and History: From Curse to Salvation】**

Defeated in the 'Hogen Rebellion' of 1156, Emperor Sutoku was exiled to Sanuki (modern-day Kagawa Prefecture). He devoted himself to Buddhism to sever his desires, but was utterly ignored by the imperial court and passed away in anger. Subsequently, a series of disasters struck Kyoto, and this shrine was established to appease his restless spirit.
Initially, he was worshipped out of fear, but this gradually transformed into the belief that "just as the emperor cut off all his desires, he will also sever the bad ties that trouble us," making it the 'Enkiri' sanctuary it is today.

### 2. 🕳️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: Reborn by Passing Through the Stone

The shrine grounds are small but filled with the fervent energy of people waiting to pass through the stone.

#### **The Stone for Severing and Tying Bonds (Enkiri Enmusubi Hi)**

This is the main attraction! A massive stone monument, 1.5 meters high and 3 meters wide. It is so completely covered in white paper charms (katashiro) that its original stone surface is invisible. In the center is a hole just large enough for one adult to pass through.

**[The Stone Crawling Ritual]**

1.  **Pray at the Main Hall**: First, pay your respects to the deity at the main hall (honden).
2.  **Write on a Katashiro**: Obtain a paper slip at the reception desk (donation of 100 yen or more) and write down the bad connection you wish to sever and the good connection you wish to form.
3.  **Sever the Bad Tie**: Holding the paper, crawl through the hole from the **front to the back**. (Parting with the bad tie)
4.  **Form the Good Tie**: Crawl back through the hole from the **back to the front**. (Forging the good tie)
5.  **Offer the Charm**: Paste your paper slip onto any spot you like on the monument using the provided glue.

The act of crawling through the narrow hole is symbolic, representing a rebirth, much like passing through a mother's womb.

#### **Kushizuka (Comb Mound)**

This is a mound where old combs and hair ornaments are laid to rest. In Japanese culture, a woman's hair is a symbol of life force and beauty, but it can also be a place where grudges (恨) reside. By making offerings of combs, visitors pray for beauty and women's happiness.

#### **Konpira Ema-kan (Ema Museum)**

This small museum displays a collection of ema (votive plaques) from various eras, dedicated from all over Japan. Take a look at how people's earnest wishes have been expressed through pictures.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Token of Decision and a New Start

The amulets and souvenirs at Yasui Konpiragu emphasize the balance between 'severing' and 'tying'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

A simple goshuin featuring the calligraphy **'安井金比羅宮 (Yasui Konpiragu)'** and a red treasure seal (宝印). It feels like proof of one's firm resolve to cut off bad ties.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

-   **Enkiri & Enmusubi Set**: A set containing two charms, one for severing bad ties and one for forging good ones, is the most popular item. It signifies getting rid of the bad to make room for the good.
-   **Bad Habit Breaking Charm**: Recommended for those who want to quit bad habits like illness, alcohol, smoking, or gambling.
-   **Ring Charm**: A ring-shaped charm symbolizing the circle of a relationship.
