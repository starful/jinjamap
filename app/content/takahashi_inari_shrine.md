### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the deities (御祭神) enshrined there and the ancient stories it holds. What deities reside in the heart of Takahashi Inari Shrine, and what fateful revelation led them to be enshrined here?

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

Three principal deities are enshrined at Takahashi Inari Shrine.

- **Ukanomitama-no-kami (宇迦之御魂神)**: The main deity (主祭神) of the shrine, affectionately known as 'Oinari-san'. Originally a god of grains and agriculture, with the changing times, this deity has come to be worshipped as a god who brings prosperity to commerce and industry, including **business prosperity and financial luck**. This is the deity to whom visitors pray most fervently.
- **Sarutahiko-no-kami (猿田彦大神)**: The **'god of guidance'** who shows the correct path at crossroads. He imparts wisdom to those facing important life decisions or preparing for new beginnings, and he is a guardian deity who ensures safety in traffic and travel.
- **Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto (天鈿女命)**: The **'goddess of arts and entertainment'** who famously lured the sun goddess out of a cave. In addition to success in the arts, she possesses the power of **'connection (en)'**, which forges good relationships between people, aiding in romantic fulfillment and harmonious human relations.

As such, Takahashi Inari Shrine is beloved as a power spot that brings deep comfort and hope to people of all ages, as it enshrines powerful deities who oversee the three major pillars of life: **wealth, life's direction, and human relationships**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Revelation of the White Fox】**

The story of Takahashi Inari Shrine's founding dates back about 520 years to 1496, during the Muromachi period.

One night, a **white fox (白狐)**, disguised as an old man with white hair, appeared in the dream of Inatsu Gengozaemon, a vassal of the local ruling family. The old man whispered in a mystical voice:

> "I am the god of Inari who has protected this land of Takahashi since ancient times. If you prepare a sacred place to enshrine me in this land, I promise abundance and prosperity to your clan and all the people of this land."

Awakening from the dream, he realized it was a divine revelation and reported it to his lord, leading to the establishment of the shrine. This was the beginning of Takahashi Inari Shrine. Later, during the Edo period, it flourished under the devout protection of the Kato and Hosokawa clans, the lords of the Kumamoto domain. It is said that before building castles or undertaking major construction projects, the lords would always visit this shrine to pray for success.

Its fame grew to the point where it was counted among the **'Three Great Inari Shrines of Japan'**, alongside Fushimi Inari in Kyoto and Yutoku Inari in Saga. A belief that began with one man's dream grew over hundreds of years into a major center of faith.

### 2. A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The grounds of Takahashi Inari Shrine are filled with a sacred atmosphere and beautiful sights.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden)・Hall of Worship (Haiden)】**

The Haiden, located at the center of the grounds, is a magnificent and intricately detailed wooden structure. It is here that you offer your prayers following the basic Japanese shrine etiquette of **'Nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (Two bows, two claps, one bow)**.

1. Place a coin into the offering box.
2. Bow deeply twice.
3. Clap your hands twice at chest level.
4. Join your hands and pray earnestly.
5. Finally, bow deeply once more.

#### **【Symbolic Structure: Ukitorii (浮き鳥居)】**

The first thing that catches your eye at the shrine is the **'Ukitorii'**, which seems to float serenely on the surface of a pond. The reflection of the red torii gate on the water creates a mystical and dreamlike scene. In spring, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, or in autumn, when the leaves change color, it offers a picturesque view, making it a famous spot for photography.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Path of Senbon Torii (千本鳥居)**: On the path leading to the main hall, countless red torii gates form a tunnel. These have been donated by people whose wishes were granted, as a sign of gratitude. Feel the powerful energy as you walk this path where red light and shadows intersect.
- **The Attendant White Foxes (Fox Statues)**: Take a closer look at the fox statues located throughout the grounds. The meaning differs depending on the object held in their mouths. A stalk of rice represents abundance, a key represents the storehouse of wealth, and a scroll symbolizes wisdom. Try to find the fox with the energy you need.
- **Prayer Stone (祈願石)**: This is a mystical stone said to grant wishes when you touch it while praying. It is said to be particularly effective for matchmaking and marital harmony. Gently stroke the stone and feel its warm energy.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Proof of Your Visit

Another joy of visiting a shrine is collecting the Goshuin and Omamori that can only be obtained there.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Takahashi Inari Shrine is impressive with its powerful and elegant calligraphy. The shrine's name, '高橋稲荷神社', is written in bold strokes in the center, and the red seals are stamped clearly, making it like a work of art. You may be able to receive limited-edition Goshuin during special periods, so be sure to check in advance.

#### **【Omamori (お守り)・Engimono (縁起物)】**

- **Yobidashi no Suzu (The Bell that Summons Fortune)**: This is the most famous souvenir here. Its clear and refreshing chime is said to 'call in' good luck and wealth, making it very popular. It is the perfect gift for business owners or those embarking on a new beginning.
- **Byakko Omikuji (White Fox Fortune Slip)**: Inside a cute white fox-shaped ceramic figurine is a paper slip with your fortune written on it. After reading your fortune, the ceramic fox can be used as a decorative item, making it very popular.
- **Business Prosperity Charm**: This charm, elaborately embroidered with gold thread, contains the powerful blessings of the main deity, Ukanomitama-no-kami. It is good to keep it in your wallet or place it in your office.
