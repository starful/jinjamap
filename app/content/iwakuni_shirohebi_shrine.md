title: Meet the Messenger of a Living God! A Pilgrimage to Yamaguchi's 'Iwakuni Shirohebi
  Shrine' for an Explosion of Wealth Luck
---

Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

In the eastern part of Yamaguchi Prefecture lies the historic city of Iwakuni, famous for its elegant five-arched bridge, 'Kintaikyo,' and 'Iwakuni Castle' perched atop a mountain. Here, you'll find a center of faith so unique that it's hard to find a parallel anywhere else in Japan, or even the world.

This is the **'Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine' (岩国白蛇神社)**, which enshrines the living messenger of the gods, the **'White Snake of Iwakuni (シロヘビ)'**.

Unlike ordinary shrines that deify mythological beings or historical figures, this shrine venerates the 'white snake,' a real, living creature and a designated natural monument. The gratitude for snakes that protected rice granaries centuries ago has sublimated into a faith that today attracts worshippers from all over the country, drawn by word-of-mouth that it offers powerful blessings for "financial luck and business prosperity."

Join me today on a pilgrimage as we follow the legend of the mystical, red-eyed white snake, open the gates of the shrine, and feel the deep history and sacred energy that dwells within.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

Rather than worshiping the 'white snake' itself as a god, Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine is a place that venerates the white snake as a 'messenger of the gods' while enshrining deities who govern wealth and fortune.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

At the center of this shrine sit powerful deities symbolizing abundance and prosperity.

- **Ukanomitama-no-kami (宇迦之御魂神)**
  This is the main deity of Inari shrines, commonly known as 'Oinari-san.' Originally a god of grains and agriculture, over time, this deity came to be widely worshipped as a bringer of prosperity in commerce and industry. This is perhaps the most fitting deity for the legend of the white snakes that guarded the rice granaries.

- **The Three Munakata Goddesses (宗像三女神) - Associated Deities (配祀神)**
  Tagorihime, Takitsuhime, and **Ichikishimahime-no-mikoto (市杵島姫神)** are enshrined together. Ichikishimahime, in particular, is identified with **Benzaiten (弁財天)**, the only goddess among the Seven Lucky Gods and the deity of wealth and the arts. Since ancient times, snakes, especially white ones, have been considered sacred messengers (神使) of Benzaiten, making her a crucial deity that completes the identity of this shrine.

As you can see, the deities enshrined here are all connected by the keywords 'abundance,' 'wealth,' and 'prosperity.' And the messenger who conveys the will of these gods to the human world is none other than the 'White Snake of Iwakuni.'

#### **【Origin and History: From Guardian of Rice Granaries to Natural Monument】**

The history of Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine does not begin with ancient mythology but with a mysterious phenomenon that actually occurred in the land of Iwakuni during the Edo period.

The story dates back about 300 years. At that time, the economic foundation of the Iwakuni domain was rice, and there were large granaries called 'komegura' everywhere to store the harvested rice. Then, at some point, mysterious snakes with snow-white bodies and ruby-red eyes began to appear around these granaries.

People who were initially afraid soon discovered something amazing. These white snakes were preying on the rats that stole the rice. Granaries where white snakes appeared had significantly less damage from rats, and the rice was kept safe. People began to believe that these snakes were not just animals, but **"guardian deities who protect the rice granaries and bring abundance, and messengers of Lady Benzaiten."**

Beliefs like "seeing a white snake brings wealth" and "a white snake entering your home brings fortune" spread uncontrollably, and people carefully protected the snakes without harming them. Thanks to this folk belief, the white snakes of Iwakuni were able to maintain their population without going extinct.

In modern times, it has been revealed that these white snakes are albino individuals of the Japanese rat snake (アオダイショウ). However, for a mutation to be stably inherited in a specific region and form a colony is a globally unprecedented phenomenon. In recognition of their value, they were designated as a National Natural Monument in 1972 under the name **'Iwakuni no Shirohebi.'**

The desire to create a vessel for the faith that had long existed in the hearts of local residents finally came to fruition, and on December 16, 2012, the 'Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine' was formally established. Although the buildings are new, the history of the faith they contain spans over 300 years.

### 2. A Walk Through the Grounds: Sights and Powerspots

The shrine grounds, where modern sensibilities and traditional shrine formalities are in harmony, are impeccably maintained. From the moment you step inside, you can feel a clear energy that calms the mind.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)**

The Haiden (Worship Hall) and Honden (Main Hall), the center of worship, are built in the Shinmei-zukuri style using light-colored wood. The simple appearance, which highlights the natural beauty of the wood rather than ornate decorations, exudes a greater sense of divinity.

Standing before the Haiden, first compose your body and mind, and then offer your prayers respectfully.

1. Quietly place your offering (**Osaisen**) into the box.
2. Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle (**Nirei**).
3. Clap your hands twice at chest height (**Nihakushu**). (The key is to have your right hand slightly lower!)
4. Put your hands together and make your earnest wish, such as for financial luck or business prosperity.
5. Finally, bow deeply once more (**Ichirei**) to conclude.

#### **Symbolic Structures and Decorations**

As you walk around the grounds, you will discover unique decorations with a 'white snake' motif everywhere. It's fun to look around as if on a scavenger hunt.

- **Snake Chozuya (手水舎)**: This is where you purify your hands and mouth before praying. While water usually flows from a dragon's mouth, here, clear water flows from the mouth of a coiled white snake. This firmly establishes the place as a 'sacred ground of snakes' right from the start of your visit.
- **White Torii (鳥居)**: The torii gate marking the entrance to the shrine is also painted a clean white, not the usual red or natural wood color.
- **Snake Roof Tiles**: Look closely at the Onigawara (demon tiles) decorating the ends of the Haiden's roof. Instead of fearsome demon faces, you'll find coiled snakes sculpted to protect the shrine.

#### **Hidden Gems & Powerspots: Meeting the Living Messengers of the Gods**

This is the highlight of a visit to Iwakuni Shirohebi Shrine, something you absolutely cannot experience at any other shrine: meeting a **'living white snake'** in person.

- **Shirohebi Viewing Facility (白蛇観覧所)**
  Right next to the shrine, there is a viewing facility where the white snakes are bred and protected. Through a glass window, you can see several white snakes living their lives up close.
  The gentle-natured white snakes are often coiled on branches or moving slowly. The moment you meet their snow-white scales and ruby-like sparkling red eyes, you feel a strange thrill and a sense of reverence. It's a moment when you understand with your whole body why the people of old considered them messengers of the gods. This is arguably the most powerful powerspot in the shrine. We hope you will make eye contact with the living messengers of the gods and receive their sacred energy.

- **Benzaiten-sha (弁財天社)**
  In a corner of the grounds, there is a small, separate shrine dedicated to Benzaiten. Since this is where the master deity of the white snakes is enshrined, visiting and praying here is said to further enhance your luck in wealth and the arts.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Proof of Your Visit

After finishing your prayers, get a goshuin and an omamori as a memento of your visit. The shrine is full of special items specializing in 'financial luck.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The white snake is undoubtedly the star of the goshuin here.

- **Standard Goshuin**: The calligraphic characters for 'Iwakuni Shirohebi Jinja' are powerfully written in the center, accompanied by a red seal and a gold or silver stamp depicting a white snake. It's a simple yet beautiful design that clearly shows the shrine's identity.
- **Special Goshuin**: On New Year's or special anniversaries, they may offer limited-edition goshuin on colored paper or with a design featuring the year's zodiac animal alongside the white snake.

#### **【Omamori (Amulets) & Engimono (Lucky Charms)】**

If you wish for an increase in financial luck, the amulet office here is nothing short of a treasure trove.

1. **Shed Skin Amulet (抜け殻お守り)** ★Highly Recommended★
    This is the shrine's specialty, known as the 'ultimate financial luck charm.' It's an amulet containing a piece of a **real white snake's shed skin (抜け殻)**. Snakes grow and regenerate by shedding their skin, a process believed to symbolize 'infinite prosperity,' 'asset growth,' and 'warding off misfortune.' It's the most popular item and often sells out first due to the belief that "if you keep it in your wallet, money will never run out."
2. **Shirohebi Omamori (白蛇お守り)**
    This is an elegant amulet with a white snake embroidered in gold thread on a white background. It protects overall fortune, including financial luck, business prosperity, and family safety.
3. **Ceramic Shirohebi Figurine (白蛇の置物)**
    This cute ceramic white snake figurine is a lucky charm (engimono) to be placed at the entrance of a home or shop, or on top of a safe. It is said to invite fortune and prevent wealth from escaping, making it a popular gift for new business openings.
