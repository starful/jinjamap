### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

As its name suggests, Daikokushu Shrine has a unique structure, housing two shrines together: **'Shikitsumatsunomiya'** and **'Okuninushi Shrine'**. Thanks to this, visitors can receive a more diverse range of divine protection.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

- **Shikitsumatsunomiya (敷津松之宮)**
  - **Susanoo-no-Mikoto (素盞嗚尊)**: The god of storms and the sea, and a heroic deity who vanquished the eight-headed serpent, Yamata no Orochi. His immense power is believed to be highly effective in **warding off evil (厄除け)** and **curing illnesses**.
  - **Ooyatsuhime-no-Mikoto (大屋津姫命)**: The goddess of trees, who aids in the prosperity of the timber industry.

- **Okuninushi Shrine (大国主神社)**
  - **Okuninushi-no-Mikoto (大国主命)**: Known as the 'god of nation-building' who founded the country, he is also famous for the tale where his benevolent nature led him to save a rabbit in distress. He has earned absolute faith as the god of **matchmaking (縁結び)**, who forges good relationships between people.
  - **Kotoshironushi-no-Mikoto (事代主命)**: The son of Okuninushi, identified with 'Ebisu (えびす),' one of the Seven Lucky Gods. As the god who oversees the flourishing of fishing and commerce, he is the god of **business prosperity (商売繁盛)** and has been deeply revered by the merchants of Osaka.

Thus, Daikokushu Shrine is a very special place that enshrines deities who encompass a wide range of human desires—from the mighty power to ward off evil, the great wisdom that built a nation, to the abundance that brings business prosperity and good relationships.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend that Began with a Pine Tree】**

The history of this shrine dates back to the age of myths. Its beginnings are deeply connected to the story of the legendary heroine, **Empress Jingu (神功皇后)**.

Around the 3rd century AD, while returning from a military expedition, Empress Jingu navigated through rough waves and landed at what is now Osaka Bay. To thank the gods for her safe return, she is said to have personally uprooted a pine tree (松) from the coast and planted it in this land of Shikitsu (敷津). The local people, revering this pine tree as sacred, built a shrine on the spot and began to worship Susanoo-no-Mikoto. This marked the beginning of **Shikitsumatsunomiya (敷津松之宮)**.

As time passed, the shrine entered a new era in 1744, during the Edo period. At that time, the Kizu (木津) area where the shrine was located was home to the 'Kizu Market,' the heart of Osaka's economy. The vibrant market merchants desperately needed a god who would bring them business prosperity and financial luck.

In response, the spirit of Okuninushi-no-Mikoto was invited from Izumo Taisha (出雲大社) to be enshrined alongside, and the 'Okuninushi Shrine' was established within the grounds. Okuninushi-no-Mikoto is a deity identified with **Daikokuten (大黒天)**, one of the Seven Lucky Gods and a symbol of wealth and abundance. From this time, the shrine became known as 'Kizu no Daikoku-san' and established itself as a sacred site for financial luck and business prosperity.

In particular, the custom of **'worshipping at both shrines (両参り)'**, where visiting both the Ebisu god (the son) at the adjacent 'Imamiya Ebisu Shrine' and the Daikoku god (the father) at Daikokushu Shrine is believed to double the blessings, has been passed down among Osaka merchants as an unwritten rule.

### 2. A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The moment you pass through the shrine's torii gate and step into the grounds, the clamor of the bustling city fades away, and a tranquil sanctuary unfolds. Here are the power spots you shouldn't miss.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Hall of Worship (Haiden)】**

This is the center of worship. Here, you can offer your prayers reverently following the basic etiquette of Japanese shrine worship, **'two bows, two claps, one bow (二礼二拍手一礼)'**.

1.  Place a coin in the offering box and ring the bell.
2.  Bow deeply at a 90-degree angle twice.
3.  Clap your hands twice at chest level.
4.  Put your hands together and make a heartfelt wish.
5.  Finally, bow deeply once more.

Don't miss the majestic sight of the giant 'shimenawa' (sacred rope) hanging under the eaves of the Haiden.

#### **【Shishiden (獅子殿): The Giant Mouth that Swallows Misfortune】**

The most overwhelming symbol of Daikokushu Shrine is the **Shishiden (Lion Hall)**. This massive stage, shaped like a lion's head and standing 12 meters tall and 11 meters wide, instantly captivates onlookers. The lion's wide-open mouth seems to radiate an aura powerful enough to swallow all the world's bad luck and misfortune in a single gulp, beckoning good fortune and victory (勝運).

In fact, the lion's eyes are headlights and its nose is a speaker, and it is used as a stage for Shinto music and dance (神楽) performances during festivals. Stand before the Shishiden, meet its enormous eyes, and cast away your anxieties to receive its powerful purifying energy. It is also a very popular photo spot.

#### **【Daikoku-sama, Ebisu-sama, and the 'Tanesen'】**

In front of the Okuninushi Shrine stand stone statues of Daikoku-sama holding a magic mallet and Ebisu-sama holding a sea bream. A very special ritual for financial luck is passed down here: the **'Tanesen (種銭, seed money)'**.

1.  Receive a charm pouch called 'O-tanesen (お種銭)' from the shrine office.
2.  Place the coin inside it in your own wallet or safe to serve as a 'seed for your funds.'
3.  A year later, with gratitude for the increased wealth, return more money to the shrine than you borrowed (a practice known as 'baigaeshi' or returning double).

This is both a pledge and a promise to cultivate abundance through your own efforts, using the god's blessing as a seed. Many business owners visit here every year to pray for prosperity in the new year.

#### **【Atsuhime Inari Shrine (熱姫稲荷神社) and its Red Torii Gates】**

In one corner of the grounds, there is a small shrine lined with red torii gates. This is where the Inari (稲荷) deity, the god of business prosperity and abundance, is enshrined. Feel the mystical atmosphere as you walk through the tunnel of red torii. It is said that after praying to Daikoku-sama and Ebisu-sama, visiting here as well will further strengthen the energy of business prosperity.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets (授与品): Proof of Your Visit

After completing your worship, be sure to get a goshuin and omamori to commemorate your connection with the gods and as proof of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Daikokushu Shrine is special because it features the names of both shrines. In the center, the characters for '敷津松之宮' or '大国主神社' are powerfully written, and a red stamp of Daikokuten's magic mallet or the shrine's crest is imprinted. During New Year's or festival periods, you might be able to receive a limited-edition goshuin, so be sure to check in advance.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

The shrine is full of items to boost your financial luck.

-   **Tanesen Pouch (種銭守り)**: An essential item for the 'Tanesen' ritual described earlier. It contains the coin that will become the seed of your wealth.
-   **Uchide-no-kozuchi (打ち出の小槌) Charm**: A charm in the shape of a magic mallet, believed to shower you with wealth and good fortune when shaken.
-   **Ichiryōban (一両判) Gold Coin Charm**: A charm modeled after an Edo-period gold coin. It is believed to increase financial luck when kept in a wallet.
-   **Matchmaking (縁結び) Charm**: A charm that carries the blessings of Okuninushi-no-Mikoto to pray for good relationships.
