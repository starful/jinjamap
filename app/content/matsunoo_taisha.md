### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

Matsunoo Taisha primarily enshrines two deities.

- **Oyamagui-no-kami (大山咋神)**: A mountain god who personifies Mount Matsunoo itself and is a great deity who pioneered the Kinki region. The 'kui' (くい) in the name means 'stake,' symbolizing the powerful force that defines boundaries and governs territories. For this reason, he has been worshipped since ancient times as the god of pioneering, civil engineering, and architecture, and is revered as the guardian deity who leads all industries to development and prosperity.
- **Ichikishimahime-no-mikoto (市杵島姫命)**: One of the three goddesses, the 'Munakata Three Goddesses (宗像三女神),' born from the pledge between Amaterasu Omikami (天照大御神) and Susanoo-no-mikoto (素戔嗚尊). She is widely known as the goddess of maritime and traffic safety, wealth, and the arts. Enshrined together with Oyamagui-no-kami as his wife, she is said to also grant blessings for family peace, marital harmony, and safe childbirth.

The combination of these two deities signifies more than just a meeting of mountain and sea; it represents **the pioneering power that leads to new beginnings and the protective power that safeguards and enriches that prosperity**. They are deities who offer deep comfort and courage to those starting a business, facing a new challenge, or praying for a safe voyage through life.

#### **【Origin and History】**

The history of Matsunoo Taisha dates back to 701, long before Kyoto became the capital, but its roots extend into the age of mythology. Following its story is like turning the pages of ancient Japanese history one by one.

**1. The Immigrant Hata Clan and the God of Mount Matsunoo**

The founding of Matsunoo Taisha is deeply connected to the 'Hata clan (秦氏),' an immigrant clan (*toraijin*) that crossed over from the Korean peninsula around the 5th century. Possessing advanced skills in sericulture, weaving, civil engineering, and brewing, the Hata clan were the main architects who developed the then-barren Kyoto Basin into a fertile land.

According to legend, the clan's patriarch, Hata no Tori, discovered a sacred turtle in a valley at the foot of Mount Matsunoo while hunting. Taking this as a divine revelation, he began to worship the mountain god, Oyamagui-no-kami, who was enshrined in the 'iwakura' (磐座, a rock where a god resides) at the mountain's summit, as the guardian deity of the entire mountain. This was the beginning of the faith of Matsunoo Taisha. It offers a glimpse into the original form of ancient Shinto faith, where people revered the mountain itself as a deity in an era before shrine buildings existed.

**2. The Western Guardian of Heian-kyō**

As time passed, the status of Matsunoo Taisha rose dramatically when Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Heian-kyō, present-day Kyoto, in 794. To pray for the prosperity and well-being of the new capital, the emperor designated the Kamo Shrines to the east and **Matsunoo Taisha to the west as the official guardian deities of the state**. Corresponding to the Blue Dragon (靑龍) of the east and the White Tiger (白虎) of the west in Feng Shui, these two shrines became the most important shrines protecting Kyoto for over a thousand years. Receiving the full reverence of the Imperial Court, Matsunoo Taisha earned the glorious title of 'Guardian of Heian-kyō.'

**3. Becoming Japan's Foremost 'God of Sake'**

One cannot speak of Matsunoo Taisha without mentioning its reputation as the 'God of Sake (酒の神様).' The Hata clan also plays a role here. With their outstanding brewing skills, the Hata clan used the clear, pure water gushing from the foot of Mount Matsunoo to brew excellent sake.

In particular, the water from a well within the precincts called **'Kamei (亀井)' was rumored to never spoil when mixed into sake, while deepening its flavor and aroma**. As this rumor spread, brewers from all over the country began to visit, regarding this water as sacred. Subsequently, Matsunoo Taisha naturally came to be widely worshipped as the god of brewing and sake. To this day, countless manufacturers of fermented products such as sake, miso (soybean paste), and shoyu (soy sauce) across Japan offer their deep faith here. The massive sake barrels (酒樽) lined up endlessly within the precincts are a testament to this long-held belief.

Thus, Matsunoo Taisha holds a truly grand and fascinating history, beginning with ancient mountain worship, passing through the devotion and efforts of an immigrant clan and the national duty as the capital's guardian, to finally establish itself as the 'God of Sake,' deeply ingrained in the life and culture of the Japanese people.

### 2. 境内 Stroll: Sights and Power Spots

The precincts of Matsunoo Taisha are filled with a sacred atmosphere, beautiful nature, and interesting sights. Let's take a journey through time, discovering the stories contained within as we walk.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

Deep inside the precincts, the majestic Worship Hall (拝殿, Haiden) and, behind it, the Main Hall (本殿, Honden) come into view. The current Honden was rebuilt in 1397 and is designated as a national **Important Cultural Property**.

The architectural style of the Honden is a very rare and unique form called 'Matsuo-zukuri (松尾造り)' or 'Ryō-nagare-zukuri (両流造)'. Unlike typical shrine roofs that slope down in one direction, the Matsuo-zukuri boasts beautiful curves with the roof flowing gracefully down on both the front and back sides. This is an architectural expression of the sanctity and dignity of the space where the deity resides. Although it is difficult to see the Honden up close, simply joining your hands in prayer before the Haiden and feeling the presence of the god beyond is enough to fill one with reverence.

The standard prayer etiquette is 'two bows, two claps, one bow' (二拝二拍手一拝, *nihai-nihakushu-ippai*). Quietly state your name and address in your heart, then convey your gratitude and wishes.

#### **【Symbolic Torii and Structures】**

- **Ichino-torii (First Torii) and Sakadaru (Sake Barrels)**: The massive stone torii standing right in front of Matsunoo-taisha Station is the first gateway into the precincts. Walking along the path past this torii, you will be overwhelmed by the hundreds of sake barrels (酒樽, *sakadaru*) lined up like giant walls on both sides. These are offerings from breweries across Japan, filled with gratitude and prayers for prosperity, creating a symbolic landscape that instantly shows this is a sanctuary dedicated to the 'God of Sake.' Just looking at the barrels with their different labels is an interesting experience.

- **Shinshi (Divine Messengers): The Turtle and the Carp**: The animals considered divine messengers (*shinshi*) at Matsunoo Taisha are the 'turtle' and the 'carp.' As mentioned earlier, this is because a turtle appears in the founding legend. You can easily find sculptures and decorations featuring turtle and carp motifs throughout the precincts. In particular, the 'Nade-kame-san (撫で亀さん, Stroking Turtle)' in front of the Haiden is said to grant long life and health if you stroke it while making a wish, and many people do so with great care. The sight of real carp swimming leisurely in the pond also adds to the peaceful atmosphere.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Kamei-no-mizu (Turtle Well Water, 亀井の水)**: This is arguably the ultimate power spot, the very heart of Matsunoo Taisha. Located beside the Honden under a small waterfall, this sacred well water has been revered as the 'water of longevity' and the 'water of revival.' As told before, legend says that drinking this water brings long life, and adding it to sake prevents it from spoiling. Even today, many worshippers line up to collect this water. Take a sip of the cool, clear sacred water to purify your body and mind, and feel the divine energy with your whole being.

- **Reiki-no-taki (Sacred Turtle Waterfall, 霊亀の滝)**: This small waterfall flows down from Mount Matsunoo, just behind the Kamei well. As the source of the well's water, the area is filled with a sacred aura. Just standing for a moment and listening to the cool sound of the water can calm a troubled mind.

- **Shōfūen Garden (松風苑)**: Another treasure of Matsunoo Taisha is a set of three beautiful gardens designed by the representative landscape architect of the Showa era, Shigemori Mirei.
  - **Jōko-no-niwa (Garden of High Antiquity)**: This garden recreates the ancient *iwakura* (sacred rocks) where gods were believed to descend. The rough and dynamic arrangement of stones emanates overwhelming energy.
  - **Kyokusui-no-niwa (Winding Stream Garden)**: This garden is themed on the elegant Heian period banquets, 'Kyokusui-no-en (曲水の宴).' The gracefully flowing stream and gentle curves create a peaceful atmosphere.
  - **Hōrai-no-niwa (Garden of Hōrai)**: This is a *karesansui* (dry landscape) garden expressing the mythical paradise where immortals live. The stone islands shaped like a turtle and a crane in the pond embody the wish for eternal youth and longevity.
    These three gardens each showcase a different historical style, beautifully encapsulating the deep history of Matsunoo Taisha through the art of gardening. There is a separate admission fee, but they are well worth a visit.
