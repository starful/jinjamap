Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I want to guide you to a small, mystical island floating on the blue sea of Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan: **Aoshima (青島)**. Accessible by a single bridge, this place boasts an exotic landscape that feels like another world, with its dense subtropical forest, the strange rock formations surrounding it, and the red shrine at its heart.

This is **'Aoshima Shrine (青島神社)'**. It is the stage for the most romantic love story in Japan's founding mythology and a sacred site for 'matchmaking (enmusubi),' where countless lovers come to pledge their eternal love. Shall we begin a special pilgrimage here, where the sound of the waves whispers like the gods, and face the legends of ancient times?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Protagonists of a Mythical Love Story

Before passing through the red torii gate of Aoshima Shrine, let's first hear the stories of the gods enshrined here. A love story as dramatic as a movie awaits you.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of Love and Adventure】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto (also known as Yamasachihiko)**. He is a very important god, the son of the heavenly grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto and the grandfather of Japan's first emperor, Emperor Jimmu.
Enshrined alongside him are his wife, **Toyotamahime-no-Mikoto** (daughter of the sea god), and **Shiotsuchi-no-Okami**, the god of wisdom who acted as their Cupid.

Because these three deities are gathered here, Aoshima Shrine is known to have powerful blessings for **'matchmaking (love)'**, **'marital harmony'**, **'safe childbirth'**, and **'maritime safety'**.

#### **【Origins and History: A Lost Fishhook and a Fateful Encounter】**

The shrine's origins begin with the famous myth of 'Yamasachihiko and Umisachihiko.'
The younger brother, Yamasachihiko (the mountain hunter), borrows a fishhook from his older brother, Umisachihiko (the sea fisherman), goes out to sea, and loses it. As his brother rages, the god of wisdom, Shiotsuchi-no-Okami, appears and shows the distressed younger brother the way to the sea god's palace (the Dragon Palace).

Upon arriving at the Dragon Palace, Yamasachihiko meets the beautiful princess Toyotamahime, falls in love, and marries her. After three dream-like years, Yamasachihiko finds the lost fishhook and returns to the surface. The place where he is said to have built his palace and lived is this very **Aoshima**.

The tale has a poignant epilogue: Toyotamahime, heavily pregnant, later comes ashore to find her husband. However, during childbirth, her true form (a shark or a dragon) is revealed, and she returns to the sea in sorrow. Aoshima Shrine is a sacred site of myth that encompasses their meeting, love, and the pain of their separation.

### 2. 🌴 A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Sacred Sanctuary in a Jungle

The path to Aoshima Shrine is an adventure in itself.

#### **The Ogre's Washboard (鬼の洗濯板)**

Look down from the 'Yayoi Bridge' leading to the island. A bizarre, wave-like rock formation that looks as if a giant used it as a washboard surrounds the entire island. This is a natural masterpiece, designated as a National Natural Monument, formed over 7 million years as geological strata were eroded by the waves. The vast spectacle revealed at low tide is overwhelmingly mystical.

#### **The Main Hall and Subtropical Plants**

Pass through the torii gate at the island's entrance, and the atmosphere changes completely. Over 5,000 Livistona palm trees form a tunnel, creating the illusion of being in a Southeast Asian jungle. Amidst the deep greenery, the vibrant vermilion **Main Hall (本殿)** shines, boasting an exotic yet sacred beauty. Offer a sincere prayer here with the standard "two bows, two claps, and one bow."

#### **Motomiya (元宮) and the Ancient Prayer Path**

Take the side path to the right of the main hall to find the true power spot. After passing through the 'Ancient Prayer Path' dense with palm trees, you will find the original site of Aoshima Shrine, the **'Motomiya (元宮)'**. This is where ancient ritual artifacts were excavated, and it is filled with a primitive sanctity.
Here, you can have two special experiences.

- **Throwing Amanohiraka (Clay Discs)**: If you throw a small clay disc and it lands within the altar area, your wish will come true. If it breaks, it is said to ward off misfortune.
- **Tying Musubikoyori (Wishing Cords)**: Tie a colorful paper cord to the sacred 'Husband-and-Wife Palm Trees' while making a wish. (Pink: Romance / Purple: Health / Green: Academics, etc.)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Token of Love

Here are some special items to help you cherish the memory of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Aoshima Shrine features a harmonious blend of powerful calligraphy and a vermilion seal. The original **goshuin-cho (stamp book)**, with its design of Aoshima island and palm trees, is particularly popular for its beautiful artwork. It's the perfect souvenir to record your travel memories.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (Lucky Charms)】**

- **Knot Charm**: A knot-shaped amulet symbolizing the bond between Yamasachihiko and his wife. Recommended for those with a crush or for couples.
- **Fishhook Charm**: This charm carries the meaning of finding what was lost and 'hooking' good fortune. It's great for those earnestly searching for something or wishing for new opportunities.
- **Palm Tree Charm**: Modeled after the 'Husband-and-Wife Palm Trees' (Livistona), this charm is for peace and harmony in the home.
