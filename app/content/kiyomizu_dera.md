Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll guide you to a temple that represents both the beginning and the end of any trip to Kyoto—one of Japan's most famous and beautiful temples: **'Kiyomizu-dera (清水寺, Pure Water Temple)'**. It's a massive wooden structure standing precariously, yet firmly, on a steep cliff. The view below, a sea of red autumn leaves and cherry blossoms, is breathtaking.

Just like the Japanese proverb, "to take a leap from the stage of Kiyomizu," this is a place where earnest wishes and great resolutions gather. From the legendary waterfall where pure water (清水) springs forth, to the stone that grants love. Shall we journey together to Kiyomizu-dera, a place filled with the romance and mystery of the ancient capital, Kyoto?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Mercy Blooming Where Pure Water Springs

Behind the grandeur of Kiyomizu-dera lies the story of a monk's mystical dream and a general's change of heart.

#### **【Principal Deity (御本尊): Eleven-headed Thousand-armed Kannon Bodhisattva】**

The principal deity here is the **Eleven-headed Thousand-armed Kannon Bodhisattva**. She is the embodiment of mercy, said to see and relieve all the suffering of living beings with her eleven faces and a thousand hands. It is believed to possess powerful abilities to grant all worldly wishes, including **health**, **academic success**, **career advancement**, and **good relationships**. As a *hibutsu* (秘仏), a hidden Buddha revealed only once every 33 years, it is all the more mysterious.

#### **【Origin and History: The Deer Hunter and the Monk】**

In 778, the ascetic monk Enchin followed a revelation in a dream and arrived at the pure waterfall on Mount Otowa. There, he received a sacred log from a hermit he met and carved a statue of Kannon.
Two years later, the general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, who came to hunt deer, met Enchin, repented for the sin of taking a life, and built the temple to pray for his wife's safe childbirth. This was the beginning of Kiyomizu-dera. It was named **'Kiyomizu-dera (Pure Water Temple)'** after the waterfall.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Stage in the Sky and the Three Streams

The temple grounds are built three-dimensionally along the mountainside, making it fun to walk around. Here are the key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Niōmon (Deva Gate) and the Three-Story Pagoda**

The red **'Niōmon'** at the entrance is the face of Kiyomizu-dera. Behind it, the magnificent 31-meter-high **'Three-Story Pagoda'** is a landmark visible from anywhere in Kyoto. A photo here is a must!

#### **The Stage of Kiyomizu (Main Hall)**

The highlight of the temple! This is the **'Stage of Kiyomizu,'** where 139 massive Zelkova pillars, interlocked without a single nail, support the main hall. The view of Kyoto city and the seasonal landscapes from this stage, seemingly floating 13 meters (the height of a 4-story building) in the air, is breathtaking.

#### **Jishu Shrine (Sanctuary of Love)**

Right behind the main hall is **'Jishu Shrine,'** dedicated to the god of love. The **'Love Stones'** are a legendary popular spot; it's said that if you can walk from one stone to the other with your eyes closed, your love will be fulfilled. (It is currently under renovation, but its spiritual energy remains!)

#### **Otowa-no-taki (Otowa Waterfall)**

Heading down from the main hall, you'll find the **'Otowa Waterfall,'** where three streams of water fall. You use a long ladle to catch and drink the water while making a wish. The streams are said to represent **'academic success,' 'success in love,'** and **'health and longevity,'** respectively. But be careful—they say if you greedily drink from all three, the benefits will disappear, so choose just one!

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing Mercy and Good Fortune

The souvenirs at Kiyomizu-dera are imbued with traditional beauty.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The most representative goshuin is the one inscribed with **'大悲閣 (Daihikaku),'** an alternate name for the main hall. The powerful calligraphy and the Sanskrit stamp symbolizing Kannon Bodhisattva make it highly collectible.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Headache Amulet**: A unique amulet said to cure headaches. It's recommended for students or office workers hoping for a clear head.
- **Bell of Happiness**: A bell with a clear sound that wards off evil spirits and attracts good fortune.
- **Mini Daikokuten**: A small golden statue that attracts wealth, perfect for keeping in your wallet.
