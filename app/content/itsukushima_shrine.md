Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, we journey to see one of Japan's most iconic and beautiful landscapes: the mystical red torii gate that appears to float on the sea. This is the UNESCO World Heritage site, **'Itsukushima Shrine (嚴島神社),'** located on Miyajima Island in Hiroshima Prefecture.

At high tide, the shrine presents a fantastical illusion of floating on the water, and at low tide, you can walk right up to the base of the giant torii gate. It is a masterpiece born from 1,400 years of history, the ambition of a powerful ruler, and a deep reverence for nature.

We invite you to Itsukushima Shrine on Miyajima, the island of the gods, where deer greet you upon arrival.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Three Sea Goddesses and a Hero's Dream

Behind the beauty of Itsukushima Shrine lies a story of powerful deities and a legendary hero.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Three Munakata Goddesses】**

The shrine is dedicated to the **'Three Munakata Goddesses (Ichikishimahime, Tagorihime, and Tagitsuhime),'** who are deities of the sea and the arts.
The principal deity, Ichikishimahime, a goddess known for her beauty and talent, is believed to grant blessings for **maritime safety**, **traffic safety**, **financial fortune**, and **improvement in the arts**. She is also identified with the Buddhist deity Benzaiten, making the shrine a popular destination for artists and entertainers.

#### **【Origin and History: A Ruler's Dream Blooms upon the Sea】**

While founded in 593, the shrine was developed into its current magnificent form by the powerful Heian period warlord, **Taira no Kiyomori**. He deeply revered the shrine after receiving a divine message in a dream, and thanks to its favor, he achieved the honor of becoming the first samurai to be appointed Daijō-daijin (Chancellor of the Realm).
As a token of his gratitude, he constructed the shrine in the 'shinden-zukuri' architectural style of aristocratic residences, but built it over the sea. Legend says it was built over the water out of reverence, as one could not dare drive stakes into the sacred ground of the island of the gods. Thus, this ultimate masterpiece, a product of his aesthetic sense and power, was born.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Perfect Harmony of Sea and Architecture

As you disembark from the ferry and walk towards the shrine, the scent of the sea mixes with the sight of the vermilion sanctuary. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **O-torii (Great Torii Gate)**

The symbol of Itsukushima Shrine! This giant red gate stands 16 meters tall and weighs 60 tons. Did you know that it stands on its own weight without its pillars being buried in the seabed?

- **High Tide**: You can see its mystical appearance, as if floating on the sea.
- **Low Tide**: When the water recedes, you can walk to the base of the gate and touch its massive pillars. (Be sure to check the tide times!)

#### **Corridors and Main Hall**

Walking through the 300-meter-long vermilion corridors that connect to the main hall, a designated National Treasure, is a mesmerizing experience in itself. When the tide comes in, it feels as if you have entered a mythical dragon palace under the sea. The gaps between the floorboards of the corridors are an example of ancient wisdom, designed to relieve the pressure from rising waves.

#### **Sorihashi Bridge (Arched Bridge)**

The Sorihashi, a steeply arched bridge, was once a sacred bridge that only imperial envoys could cross. Although it's no longer possible to cross it, its elegant curve makes for a perfect photo spot.

#### **Kagami-no-ike (Mirror Pond)**

These are round pools that appear on the tidal flats at low tide. Fresh water mysteriously springs up from them amidst the salty sea, making them one of the Seven Wonders of Itsukushima Shrine.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing Victory and Happiness

The items available at Itsukushima Shrine are rich in both tradition and meaning.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin (shrine stamp) here is elegant and dignified. The calligraphy for '嚴島神社 (Itsukushima Jinja)' and the shrine's seal make for a wonderful memento of your visit to this World Heritage site.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Good Fortune Rice Paddle (Shamoji)**: A famous product of Miyajima! Because the Japanese words for "to serve rice" (meshi-toru) and "to capture the enemy" (meshi-toru) are homophones, the rice paddle has become a symbol of **victory** and **good luck**. It makes an excellent gift.
- **Traffic Safety Amulet**: Befitting a shrine to the gods of maritime safety, this amulet protects travelers and ensures safety on the road.
- **Amulet for Artistic Improvement**: Recommended for those who are learning an art form or a musical instrument.
