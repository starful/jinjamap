In the heart of Tokyo lies Akasaka (赤坂), a district bustling with glamorous skyscrapers and sophisticated shops. Within this modern urban landscape, there exists a sacred precinct, enveloped in serene, deep greenery, as if it has traveled back in time. This is **Akasaka Hikawa Shrine (赤坂氷川神社)**, which has watched over Tokyo's prosperity and the connections between its people for over 1,000 years.

This place is more than just a religious facility. It is a special 'power spot' where the breath of the Edo period lingers in its architecture, the life energy of centuries-old trees emanates, and the powerful forces of mythological deities for forging relationships and warding off misfortune intersect. Today, let's leave the noise of the complex city behind, open the gates of Akasaka Hikawa Shrine, and begin a pilgrimage to discover the mystical stories and sacred energy it holds within.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the gods enshrined there, the 'Saijin (御祭神)'. What deities reside in the heart of Akasaka Hikawa Shrine, and what river of history did they cross to stand here today?

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

Akasaka Hikawa Shrine enshrines three very important and powerful deities from Japanese mythology.

- **Susanoo-no-mikoto (素盞嗚尊)**: A god symbolizing valor and mighty power. Famous for the myth where he slays the giant serpent 'Yamata no Orochi', he is widely worshipped as the god of **'yakuyoke (厄除け)', for warding off calamities and dispelling misfortune**. He provides great strength to those praying for business prosperity or overcoming adversity.
- **Kushinadahime-no-mikoto (奇稲田姫命)**: The goddess rescued and married by Susanoo-no-mikoto. Thanks to their dramatic meeting and love story, she is deeply revered as the goddess of **'enmusubi (縁結び)', for marital harmony, family peace, and forging good relationships**.
- **Onamuji-no-mikoto (大己貴命)**: A descendant of Susanoo-no-mikoto, better known as 'Okuninushi-no-mikoto (大国主命)'. His power to forge connections is extremely strong, making him famous as the **god who presides over romantic fulfillment and broad human relationships**.

As such, these three deities are a 'family of gods'—a husband, wife, and child. Thanks to this powerful bond, Akasaka Hikawa Shrine is cherished as one of Tokyo's foremost **sacred places for matchmaking (縁結び) and family happiness**.

#### **【Origins and History: A Miraculous Place Bearing the Shogun's Wishes】**

The history of Akasaka Hikawa Shrine dates back to the misty year of 735 (Tenpyō 7). However, the shrine took center stage in history during the Edo period, thanks to the 8th Shogun, **Tokugawa Yoshimune (徳川吉宗)**.

In 1729, Yoshimune personally ordered the construction of a magnificent shrine building at its current location to pray for the peace and stability of the shogunate. This is the very same main hall we see today.

What's astonishing is that this building has endured numerous disasters over more than 290 years. It miraculously survived the great fires that swept through Edo, the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923, and even the devastating air raids that reduced Tokyo to ashes during World War II, remaining in its original form.

Thanks to this, Akasaka Hikawa Shrine has been designated as a **Tokyo Metropolitan Tangible Cultural Property**, offering visitors not just a place for prayer but the moving experience of a living history museum. Feeling the timeless architectural beauty and the weight of history in a space filled with the shogun's wishes is a special experience unique to this place.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The moment you step through the shrine gate, the clamor of the outside world fades away as if by magic, and a serene, sacred air envelops you.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) & Hall of Worship (Haiden)】**

The Haiden, the center of worship, is built in the 'gongen-zukuri (権現造)' style. The front of the Haiden is intricately carved with auspicious creatures like dragons and phoenixes, showcasing the essence of Edo-period art.

When praying here, follow the etiquette known as **'Nirei Nihakushu Ippai (二拝二拍手一拝)'**.

1. Place a coin in the offering box and ring the bell.
2. Bow deeply twice.
3. Clap your hands twice and offer your prayer.
4. Finally, bow deeply once more.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Great Ginkgo Tree (大銀杏)**: This giant ginkgo tree, over 400 years old, exudes the most overwhelming presence in the precincts. It is a symbol of resilient life force, having survived the flames of the Tokyo air raids. Simply standing for a moment under its massive shade allows you to feel an overwhelming life energy and tranquility.

- **Shiawase Inari Shrine (四合稲荷神社)**: A small Inari shrine located next to the main hall. 'Shiawase (四合)' means 'four combined' but is a homophone for 'happiness (幸せ)'. It is said to have been named by the late Edo period hero **Katsu Kaishū (勝海舟)** and is a hidden gem known for its blessings in business prosperity and wish fulfillment.

- **Sazare-ishi (さざれ石)**: Here, you can also see the 'sazare-ishi' mentioned in the Japanese national anthem. These are small pebbles that have coalesced into a giant boulder, symbolizing unity, eternity, and the prosperity of the community.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans (Juyohin): A Proof of Your Visit

After finishing your prayers, it's time to take home a token of your connection with the gods.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Akasaka Hikawa Shrine is famous for its very neat yet dignified calligraphy. In the center, a red seal with the shrine's symbol of three tomoe (巴紋) shines brightly. The **seasonal limited-edition goshuin**, which include small stamps symbolizing the season like cherry blossoms in spring or ginkgo leaves in autumn, are particularly popular among collectors.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

- **Yakan-no-suzu (やかんの鈴)**: This is the shrine's signature matchmaking charm. It's a bell shaped like a 'kettle' (yakan), but its name originates from the legendary 'rooster that crows at night'. The sound of this bell is believed to attract good relationships, making it the perfect gift for those wishing for love to blossom.
- **Enmusubi Mamori (縁結び守)**: A matchmaking charm imbued with the power of Kushinadahime-no-mikoto. It is effective not only for romance but also for fostering all good human relationships, including those at work or with friends.
- **Yakuyoke Hassō Amulet (八상 厄除け)**: Inspired by the myth of Susanoo-no-mikoto defeating the Yamata no Orochi, this charm is meant to ward off eight kinds of disasters.
