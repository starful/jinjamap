  of a Thousand-Year-Old Forest and the Stone That Pins a Giant Catfish'
---

Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll guide you to Sawara, Chiba Prefecture, a bit of a distance from Tokyo. It's a beautiful riverside town known as 'Little Edo.' Nestled beside a canal where you can enjoy boat rides, lies an ancient sanctuary with a history spanning over 2,600 years: **'Katori Jingu (Katori Shrine)'**.

This is the shrine dedicated to 'Futsunushi-no-Ōkami,' the most powerful martial god and god of the sword in Japan's founding mythology. It's a potent power spot that aids in victory, success, and firm decision-making. From the legendary stone said to hold down the head of a giant underground catfish to prevent earthquakes, to the mystical energy emanating from the lush cedar forest.

If you're facing an important challenge in life or wish to strengthen your resolve, why not journey with me into the deep forests of Katori Shrine?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The God of the Sword Who Pacified the Nation

Behind the grandeur of Katori Shrine lies one of the most dramatic stories in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (Gosaishin): Futsunushi-no-Ōkami】**

The principal deity here is **Futsunushi-no-Ōkami (経津主大神)**.
'Futsun' is said to represent the sound of a sword cutting through something. He is a martial and sword god who played a decisive role in quelling the chaos on earth under a heavenly command, creating a peaceful nation.
As a deity who brought peace not through mere force but with wisdom and decisiveness, he is believed to grant exceptional blessings for **'Luck in Competitions'**, **'Wish Fulfillment'**, and **'Warding off Misfortune'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Hero of the Nation's Cession】**

The history of Katori Shrine begins with the 'Kuniyuzuri (Cession of the Country)' myth.
Futsunushi-no-Ōkami descended to the terrestrial world in tandem with Takemikazuchi, the god of Kashima Shrine, where they subjugated the unruly deities and peacefully received the transfer of the land. For this achievement, he became revered as a **'founding god'** who laid the groundwork for Japan.
The shrine was founded in 643 BC! Its prestige is immense, being one of only three shrines, along with Ise Shrine and Kashima Shrine, to have received the title **'Jingu (神宮)'** since ancient times.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Majesty of Black Lacquer and a Mystical Stone

Katori Shrine is enveloped by a dense forest, and simply walking through its grounds is a purifying experience. Here are the must-see points.

#### **The Black Lacquer Main Hall and Worship Hall**

Built in 1700 by the Tokugawa shogunate, the main hall (honden) and worship hall (haiden) are designated as National Important Cultural Properties. Unlike the common red shrines, they feature **black lacquer (kuro-urushi)** as a base with gold accents, exuding both the dignity of a martial god and a refined elegance. Standing before them naturally inspires a sense of reverence.

#### **Kaname-ishi (The Keystone): The Stone That Prevents Earthquakes**

This is the ultimate power spot at Katori Shrine! Located on a forest path next to the main hall, the **'Kaname-ishi'** is a small stone that barely protrudes from the ground. However, legend has it that it is driven deep into the earth, pinning down the head of a giant catfish that causes earthquakes. (Kashima Shrine has a stone that pins down its tail!) Offer a prayer here for an unshakable and steadfast heart.

#### **The Giant Cedar and the Three-Forked Tree**

Within the precincts stands a giant **'sacred tree (goshinboku)'** over 1,000 years old. Its magnificent presence is overwhelming to behold. Also, the **'Sanbonsugi (three-forked cedar)'**, which has one root but splits into three trunks, is a powerful symbol of life force.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Grasping a Talisman of Victory

Here are special items you can take home, imbued with the spirit of the martial god.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Katori Shrine is neat and powerful. The bold calligraphy of **'香取神宮 (Katori Jingu)'** and the red seal feel like a reassuring talisman in themselves.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Katsumamori (Victory Amulet)**: The shrine's representative amulet, imbued with the power of the sword god Futsunushi. The character for **'Victory (勝)'** is inscribed, making it a must-have for students, athletes, and business professionals.
- **Kaname-ishi Amulet**: Just like the stone that prevents earthquakes, this amulet helps to ward off disasters and stabilize one's heart.
- **Wish-Fulfilling Amulet**: With its beautiful embroidery, this amulet also makes a wonderful gift.

### 4. 🛶 Nearby Attractions: The Romance of Little Edo, Sawara

After visiting the shrine, enjoy Sawara, a 'living museum' of a town.

#### **1. The Old Streets of Sawara (Little Edo)**

- **Access**: 15 minutes by car.
- **Features**: A beautiful streetscape where the atmosphere of the Edo period remains perfectly preserved. The willow trees lining the Onogawa River and the old merchant houses are truly picturesque.

#### **2. Boat Tour Experience (Sawara Funemeguri)**

- **Recommendation**: Take a leisurely tour of the canal on a small boat rowed by a boatman. The view of the town from the water will create an unforgettable memory. In winter, they even operate cozy kotatsu boats!

#### **3. Eel Restaurant 'Unagi Yamada'**

- **Recommended Dish**: Sawara is famous for its eel dishes. At the 300-year-old **'Unagi Yamada,'** try the **'Jikabako (steamed eel over rice)'**. The melt-in-your-mouth tenderness will wash away all your travel fatigue.
