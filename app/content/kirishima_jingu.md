Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' introducing mystical sacred sites from around the world.

Today, I'll guide you to **Kirishima (霧島)** in Kagoshima Prefecture, southern Japan, a place where myths and legends rise like mist. Nestled within the magnificent mountain range sculpted by volcanic activity is a shrine that shines like a red jewel: **'Kirishima Jingu (霧島神宮)'**.

This is the stage for the **'Tenson Korin'** (Descent of the Heavenly Grandson) myth, where 'Ninigi-no-Mikoto,' the ancestor of the Japanese Imperial Family, first descended to Earth. It is also a romantic spot where Sakamoto Ryoma and his wife, who took Japan's first honeymoon, visited and pledged their love.

Shall we journey together through the forest path guarded by a giant cedar tree over 800 years old to discover the special fortune bestowed by nine masks?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Heavenly Grandson Descends to Earth

Kirishima Jingu holds one of the most important scenes in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ninigi-no-Mikoto】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Ninigi-no-Mikoto**. He is the grandson of the sun goddess Amaterasu and descended from the heavens (Takamagahara) on her command to govern the chaotic earthly world.
He brought with him the **'Three Sacred Treasures'** (a mirror, a jewel, and a sword), which are the symbols of Japanese imperial authority. As a founding deity who spread agricultural techniques and established the foundations of the nation, he oversees **national peace**, **family safety**, and **business prosperity**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Fire-Breathing Mountain and Faith】**

It is said that the place where Ninigi-no-Mikoto first descended is the summit of **'Takachiho-no-mine,'** the highest peak of the Kirishima mountain range. There, the legendary spear **'Amanosakahoko,'** which he is said to have thrust into the ground, is still embedded.
The original shrine was located near the summit, but Mount Kirishima is an active volcano. After being repeatedly destroyed by eruptions, it was magnificently rebuilt in its current, safer location in 1715 by Yoshitaka Shimazu, the lord of the Satsuma Domain. That is why the current buildings are so splendid and delicately decorated that they are called the 'Nikko of the West.'

### 2. 🌲 A Walk Through the Precincts: The Red Shrine and the Giant Sacred Tree

The precincts of Kirishima Jingu create a mystical atmosphere with their blend of magnificent nature and splendid architecture.

#### **The Magnificent Vermilion Main Hall**

The vermilion main hall (Honden) and worship hall (Haiden), revealed amidst the dense green forest, present an overwhelming beauty. Designated as a National Treasure, these buildings are adorned with intricate carvings of dragons, phoenixes, and colorful paintings, drawing admiration from all who see them. It is said that Sakamoto Ryoma, visiting with his wife Oryo, marveled, "To think such a beautiful building exists deep in the mountains."

#### **The 800-Year-Old Sacred Tree (Goshinboku)**

Next to the worship hall stands a giant cedar tree soaring towards the sky. This sacred tree, over 800 years old and 38 meters tall, is said to be the ancestor of all cedar trees in southern Kyushu.
**Tip**: Walk around to the back of the sacred tree and look up. The shape of the branches resembles a Shinto priest (wearing an eboshi) paying respects, adding to the wonder.

#### **Sazare-ishi (Pebble Rock)**

The **'Sazare-ishi,'** mentioned in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem 'Kimigayo,' is located within the precincts. It is a rock formed from small pebbles that have bonded together over eons, symbolizing eternal prosperity and unity.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: The Luck of the Nine Masks

Introducing the unique charms and amulets of Kirishima Jingu, steeped in its own distinct legends.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Kirishima Jingu is stamped with **'Tenson Korin Hōsai-chi (天孫降臨 奉斎地),'** meaning 'The Place Where the Heavenly Grandson's Descent is Enshrined,' showcasing its historical significance. The bold and powerful calligraphy evokes the image of the god's descent.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Kumen Mamori (Nine-Mask Amulet)**: This is the most famous amulet here. It features **nine masks** symbolizing the god Sarutahiko and his companions who guided Ninigi-no-Mikoto during his descent. Legend has it that if you collect (or pay homage to) all nine masks, your wish will come true. (It aids in success in various fields such as industry, commerce, and the arts.)
- **Hoko no Omamori**: An amulet shaped like the legendary spear 'Amanosakahoko,' which is thrust into the mountain peak. It provides the power to ward off evil and forge a new path.
- **Ryoma Amulet**: Due to its connection as Japan's first honeymoon destination, amulets for **'marital harmony'** and **'matchmaking,'** inspired by the couple Ryoma and Oryo, are also popular.
