Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Just an hour by train from Tokyo lies the quiet, historic city of Kamakura. Here, hidden deep within a rocky cleft, is a mystical shrine. A place you can only reach by climbing a steep hill and passing through a dark tunnel: **'Zeniarai Benten Ugafuku Shrine (銭洗弁財天宇賀福神社)'**.

This is the most famous sacred site for **'money washing (Zeniarai)'** in all of Japan. It is a place where the legend lives on: if you wash your money in the sacred spring water gushing from within the cave, it will return to you multiplied several times over. Why not join the endless stream of visitors dreaming of financial fortune and experience this special 'ritual of the rich' for yourself?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Prophecy of an Old Man in a Dream and the Gushing Spring

The shrine's origin begins with a dream of Minamoto no Yoritomo, the founder of the Kamakura shogunate.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (Gosaishin): Benzaiten and Ugafukujin】**

This shrine jointly enshrines **'Benzaiten,'** a Buddhist guardian deity and goddess of water and wealth, and **'Ugafukujin,'** a god of grains with a human head and a snake's body. It is believed that the combination of these two deities creates a powerful synergy that increases wealth and bestows blessings.

#### **【Origin and History: The Year, Month, and Day of the Serpent】**

In 1185, Ugafukujin appeared in Yoritomo's dream and prophesied, "In a valley northwest of this land, a miraculous spring will gush forth. If you use its water to honor the gods and Buddhas, the realm will be at peace." When Yoritomo went to the location, he found clear water indeed springing from a crevice in the rocks and built a shrine there. Remarkably, that day was the **Day of the Serpent, in the Month of the Serpent, in the Year of the Serpent.**

Later, in 1257, Hojo Tokiyori established the tradition of 'Zeniarai (money washing)' that continues to this day, saying, "If you wash your money in this water to purify your heart, blessings will come," as he washed his own coins.

### 2. 🌊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Encountering a Golden Aura After Passing Through Darkness

The path to the shrine is an adventure in itself. At the top of a steep hill, the entrance is not a torii gate but a **tunnel carved through the rock**. Passing through the cool tunnel, you emerge into the mysterious shrine grounds, as if you've entered another world.

#### **Okumiya (Cave): The Core of the Zeniarai Experience**

The cave inside the shrine grounds is the core power spot. Within the dimly lit cave, illuminated by candles, clear spring water flows, and Ugafukujin is enshrined.

**[How to Wash Your Money]**

1.  Purchase a set with a candle, incense, and a bamboo basket (100 yen) from the shrine office.
2.  After praying at the main shrine, light the candle and burn the incense to purify your body and mind.
3.  Enter the cave and place your coins or bills in the basket.
4.  Use a ladle to scoop the sacred water (Zeniarai-sui) and pour it over your money three times. (For bills, just wetting the edges is okay!)
5.  Dry the washed money with a towel and put it back in your wallet.
    -   **Tip**: The key is not to hoard the washed money but to **'spend it meaningfully.'** It is believed that as the money circulates in the world, it will bring back greater fortune!

#### **Shichifuku Shrine & Shrine of the Water God (Suijin)**

Besides the cave, the grounds also feature a shrine dedicated to the Seven Lucky Gods and a lower shrine (Shimo-no-miya) dedicated to the god of water. The scenery, with its small waterfall and pond, helps to calm the mind.
