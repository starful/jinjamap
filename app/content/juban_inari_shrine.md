Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

In the stylish district of Tokyo, Azabu-Juban, amidst the glittering shops and modern skyscrapers, lies a tranquil sanctuary that seems to have traveled back in time. This is the **'Juban Inari Shrine (十番稲荷神社)'**.

More than just a place to pray for blessings, this is a power spot, a hidden gem in the city where fascinating myths and history are layered upon one another. It is particularly famous for the legend of the 'fire-extinguishing toad' and for bringing financial luck, derived from the word 'kaeru,' which means 'to return.' Today, we will open the gates of this mystical shrine and embark on a deep pilgrimage into the stories that dwell within.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

Every shrine has its guardian deities, or *saijin* (祭神), and a unique story of how they came to be enshrined. To understand the heart of Juban Inari Shrine, we must first learn about the deities enshrined here and the special history of how two shrines merged into one.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

Juban Inari Shrine is known as a highly potent place where one can receive the blessings of multiple gods at once. The main deities are as follows:

- **Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto (倉稲魂命)**
  A god of grains and food from Japanese mythology, also the main deity of Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto, the head shrine of all Inari shrines. In the past, when agriculture was central to life, this deity was a symbol of abundance and prosperity. In modern times, Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto is widely worshipped as the god governing all things related to wealth, including commercial prosperity, business success, and increased financial luck.

- **Yamato Takeru-no-Mikoto (日本武尊)**
  A legendary hero of Japan, an ill-fated prince who appears in the *Kojiki* and *Nihon Shoki*. His tale of subjugating the eastern barbarians with outstanding martial prowess has given rise to numerous legends. His strength and will are believed to ward off disasters (厄除け), and he serves as an inspiration for many, bestowing blessings for proficiency in both literary and military arts (文武両道) and success in life (出世開運).

- **Minato Ward's Seven Lucky Gods Takarabune (港区七福神 宝船)**
  Juban Inari Shrine is also one of the pilgrimage sites for the Minato Ward's Seven Lucky Gods. Unlike other shrines that each enshrine one of the seven, this shrine uniquely enshrines the 'Treasure Ship (宝船, Takarabune)' itself, on which all seven gods ride. This signifies bringing all blessings at once and is regarded as a powerful symbol of good fortune (吉運) and wish fulfillment.

#### **【Origins and History: Two Legends Become One】**

While the current structure of Juban Inari Shrine was completed in 1997, its roots stretch back over a thousand years. The shrine was born from the merger of two historic shrines: **'Suehiro Shrine (末廣神社)'** and **'Takecho Inari Shrine (竹長稲荷神社)'**. The stories surrounding these two shrines are like myths in themselves.

**Story One: Yamato Takeru's Fan and 'Suehiro Shrine'**
The protagonist of the first story is the legendary hero, Yamato Takeru-no-Mikoto. About 1,900 years ago, he set out on a long journey to conquer the eastern lands. When he reached Tokyo Bay and attempted to cross the sea, a violent storm blocked his path. At that moment, his wife, Ototachibana-hime (弟橘媛), sacrificed herself to the sea to appease the sea god's wrath, allowing Yamato Takeru to cross safely.

Continuing his journey in sorrow, he reached the present-day Azabu-Juban area and took a rest. As he lay down his weary body, he was lost in deep grief, longing for his wife. Just then, eight white swans appeared from nowhere, flew around him, and began to dance as if to console him. Empowered by this mystical sight, Yamato Takeru left his fan (扇, *ōgi*) at that spot and continued on his way.

Later, the local people built a small shrine on the spot where he left the fan to honor his great deeds and this mysterious tale. Because a fan widens at the end when opened, it is called a 'Suehiro-ōgi (末広扇),' symbolizing 'prospering towards the end.' For this reason, the shrine was named 'Suehiro Shrine (末廣神社),' and it attracted a continuous stream of visitors praying for endless prosperity and growth.

**Story Two: The Fire-Extinguishing Toad and 'Takecho Inari Shrine'**
The second story dates back to the Edo period. At that time, the residence of a powerful daimyo family, the Yamazaki clan, was located in the Azabu-Juban area. Within the estate was a large pond called 'Gamaike (蝦蟇池),' and legend had it that a giant toad (蝦蟇, *gama*) lived in this pond.

In 1772, a great fire that swept through Edo spread to the Azabu area. The flames, with ferocious intensity, consumed everything in their path and headed towards the Yamazaki residence. Just as everyone watched the fire in helpless despair, a miracle occurred. The giant toad from the pond appeared and shot a powerful stream of water from its mouth, blocking the flames. Thanks to the toad's miraculous power, the Yamazaki residence was miraculously saved from the fire.

After this mysterious event, the Yamazaki family built 'Takecho Inari Shrine (竹長稲荷神社)' within their estate to enshrine the god Inari and began to worship the spiritually powerful fire-extinguishing toad as a divine messenger. The story spread throughout Edo, and 'the Inari of Gamaike' gained great fame as a deity of fire prevention and disaster protection.

**Two Stories Become One, The Birth of 'Juban Inari Shrine'**
As time passed, Tokyo entered a period of rapid urban development after World War II. During this process, it became difficult for Suehiro Shrine and Takecho Inari Shrine to remain in their original locations. Finally, in 1950, the two shrines decided to carry on their long histories together and merged into one. Then, in 1997, a new shrine building was constructed at the current location, and it was reborn under the name 'Juban Inari Shrine.'

Thus, Juban Inari Shrine is a very special and powerful sacred site, simultaneously embodying the spirit of endless prosperity from Yamato Takeru and the protective power of the mystical toad that wards off disaster.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

Nestled between modern buildings, the grounds of Juban Inari Shrine are compact but filled with sights imbued with myth and legend. Let's walk through the grounds following the order of worship and feel their deep significance.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)**

Upon entering the grounds, the first thing that catches your eye is the worship hall (Haiden) directly in front. Built with modern reinforced concrete, it has a different feel from traditional wooden shrines, but its dignity and sacredness remain. In front of the Haiden, offer your prayers with a reverent heart, following the basic etiquette of Japanese shrine worship, 'Nihai-nihakushu-ippai (two bows, two claps, one bow).'

1.  Quietly place a coin in the offering box (Saisen-bako).
2.  Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle (Nihai).
3.  Clap your hands twice at chest level (Nihakushu). A respectful way is to slightly lower your right hand below the first knuckle of your left hand, then bring them together when you clap.
4.  With your hands still together, make your earnest wish.
5.  Finally, bow deeply one more time at a 90-degree angle to conclude (Ippai).

Behind the Haiden lies the Honden, the most sacred space where the spirit of the deity resides. Although you cannot see it directly, it is important to pray with all your heart, feeling the presence of the deities enshrined there.

#### **Gamaike (蝦蟇池) and the Fire-Extinguishing Toad Statue**

Moving to the left of the Haiden, you will find a trace of the shrine's most central power spot, 'Gamaike.' Today, it is not an actual pond but a small space commemorating the legend. Here sit two stone statues of toads, representing the legendary toad that protected the Yamazaki residence from fire.

-   **Ogama-sama (おがま様):** This is the toad statue on the right. Legend has it that if a person with an eye ailment wets their eyes with water from here, they will be cured.
-   **Pouring Water on the Toad Statue:** Many visitors pour water over the toad statues with a small ladle while making a wish. This ritual is for fire prevention and disaster protection, but it also draws on the Japanese wordplay of 'kaeru' (かえる), which means 'frog/toad,' 'to return' (帰る), and 'to be rejuvenated' (返る). It has become a beloved and powerful spot for making various wishes, such as: **"May my lost items return," "May the money I spent come back (financial luck)," and "May my youth return (health)."**

Pause here for a moment and imagine the courage and mystical power of the legendary toad that spewed water to fight the raging flames. You may feel the city's noise fade away and a sense of peace settle in your heart.

#### **Minato Ward's Seven Lucky Gods Takarabune (宝船)**

Next to Gamaike is another important symbol: a stone statue of the 'Takarabune (Treasure Ship)' carrying the Seven Lucky Gods. The sight of the seven most beloved gods in Japan—Ebisu (commerce), Daikokuten (wealth), Benzaiten (arts), Bishamonten (victory), Fukurokuju (longevity), Jurojin (wisdom), and Hotei (happiness)—all on one ship is enough to make one's heart feel abundant.

This treasure ship is a symbol of luck, sailing with all kinds of blessings. Here, you can pray for a wide range of wishes all at once, including business prosperity, financial luck, health, academic success, and good relationships. It becomes especially crowded during the New Year with visitors participating in the 'Minato Seven Lucky Gods Pilgrimage (港七福神めぐり),' playing a central role in the pilgrimage.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Items for Purchase (授与品): A Proof of Worship

Another joy of visiting a shrine is commemorating your connection with the deities through Goshuin and Omamori that can only be obtained there. Juban Inari Shrine offers charming items for purchase (授与品) that reflect its unique origins.

-   **Special Goshuin**: During the New Year period, you can receive a special Goshuin for the Seven Lucky Gods pilgrimage, which features a Takarabune seal, making it feel even more brilliant and spiritually charged. Goshuin collectors should not miss this period.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

The Omamori (charms) here are, without a doubt, most popular for their 'toad' motifs.

-   **Kaeru Omamori (かえるお守り)**: A charm that plays on the word 'kaeru,' meaning 'to return safely (無事かえる),' 'for money to return (お金がかえる),' and 'for youth to return (若がえる).' It comes with a small golden toad, making it very cute, and is said to be effective for various wishes, including travel safety, financial luck, and health.
-   **Fire Prevention Charm (火防守)**: In line with the legend of Gamaike, this is a powerful charm that protects from fire and disasters. It is said to be good to keep at home or in a place of business.
-   **Takarabune Ema (宝船の絵馬)**: Ema (絵馬, wooden plaques for writing wishes) depicting the treasure ship with the Seven Lucky Gods are also popular. It is believed that if you write a specific wish on it and hang it on the shrine grounds, the Seven Lucky Gods will grant your wish.
