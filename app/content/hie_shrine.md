  of Tokyo''s Akasaka Hie Shrine'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find sacred places like hidden gems in the city.

Today, I will guide you to a place between Nagatacho (永田町) and Akasaka (赤坂), the centers of Japanese politics and economy. Amidst the dense forest of buildings and the solemnity of the National Diet Building, there is a place nestled mysteriously like a gate to another dimension. This is **'Hie Shrine (日枝神社)'**.

This shrine has been beloved by Tokyo citizens for over 500 years, affectionately called 'Sanno-sama.' The tunnel of red torii gates, reminiscent of Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, and the unique guardian deity, the **'monkey (Shinsaru)'** statues, offer visitors a special experience. Shall we go together to feel the powerful energy that has guarded the back gate of Edo Castle and led to Tokyo's prosperity?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Guardian God Beloved by the Tokugawa Shoguns

Behind the grandeur of Hie Shrine lies a deep connection with the Tokugawa clan.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Oyamakui-no-Kami】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Oyamakui-no-Kami (大山咋神)**.
As the name, 'the god who drives stakes into the great mountain,' suggests, this deity possesses the powerful ability to rule over the land and foster the growth of all things. Therefore, it has been traditionally believed to offer excellent blessings for **business prosperity**, **safety in the construction industry**, and **household safety**. This is why businesspeople constantly visit to pray for success in the heart of Tokyo.

#### **【Origins and History: Guardian of Edo Castle】**

The history of Hie Shrine began in 1478 when Ota Dokan founded it to pray for the safety of Edo Castle during its construction. Later, when Tokugawa Ieyasu entered Edo, he revered this shrine as the **'guardian deity of Edo Castle (chinjusha)'** and the clan deity of the Tokugawa family.
In particular, the shrine's festival, the **'Sanno Matsuri,'** was known as the 'Tenka Matsuri' (Festival of the Realm), attended by the shogun himself, and became one of the three great festivals of Edo. Although it was destroyed by war and later rebuilt, its authority and fame remain among the highest in Tokyo.

### 2. 🐒 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Sacred Urban Sanctuary Guarded by Monkeys

Hie Shrine is full of unique charms that set it apart from other shrines. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Shinsaru (神猿): The Divine Monkeys that Bring Victory and Connections**

Look closely at both sides of the main hall. Instead of the usual lion-dogs (komainu) found at most shrines, there are **stone statues of a monkey couple**. The monkey is the divine messenger of Hie Shrine, the 'Shinsaru.'

- The word **'saru (猿)'** (monkey) sounds the same as 'ma ga saru (魔が去る)' (evil spirits leave), so it represents **protection from evil**.
- It is also associated with **'masaru (勝る)'** (to win/excel), symbolizing **victory** and **success**.
- Furthermore, it is linked to **'en (縁)'** (connections), helping to form **good relationships (enmusubi)**.
  It is said that stroking the **mother monkey statue holding a baby monkey** on the left side of the main hall brings safe childbirth and family harmony, while the **father monkey** statue on the right helps with business prosperity and success. Be sure to make a wish.

#### **Senbon Torii: The Red Tunnel in the City Center**

On the path leading to the Sanno Inari Shrine on the west side, there is the **'Senbon Torii,'** a dense row of red torii gates. This dreamlike red tunnel in the middle of a concrete jungle is a prime photo spot and a healing path that purifies your mind just by walking through it.

#### **Modern Accessibility: A Shrine with an Escalator**

Although it's located on a steep hill, don't worry. There is even an **escalator** installed next to the main entrance! This modern consideration allows the elderly and children to visit with ease. Enjoying the changing cityscape as you ride the escalator up is another unique pleasure.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing the Monkey's Blessing

The souvenirs at Hie Shrine are filled with cute and meaningful monkey characters.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

Hie Shrine's goshuin is stamped with **'Kojo-no-chin (皇城之鎮: Guardian of the Imperial Palace),'** showcasing its high status. The symbol of the shrine, the **'futaba aoi (wild ginger)'** crest, and sometimes a cute monkey stamp are added, making it highly collectible.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Masaru (Evil-Departing) Charm**: An amulet with a cute monkey face, available in red and white. It's an all-purpose charm to ward off bad luck and pray for victory.
- **Enmusubi Charm**: A lovely charm that uses the power of the monkey (en) to help you form good relationships.
