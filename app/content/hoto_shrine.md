title: The Mecca of First-Prize Lottery Winners? A Pilgrim's Guide to Hoto Shrine
  in Saga, the Treasure Island You Reach by Boat
---

Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

Today, I want to guide you to the waters off Karatsu City in northwestern Kyushu. Quietly floating on the blue waves of the Genkai Sea is a small island, Takashima. With a population of less than 300, this peaceful island is home to a special shrine that draws a constant stream of worshippers from all over Japan.

Its name is **'Hoto Shrine (宝当神社)'**.
Meaning 'the shrine where treasures are certain to be won,' its name alone is enough to make hearts flutter. This place is more than just a site for seeking blessings; it is a sacred space imbued with the noble spirit of a samurai who protected the island and the earnest prayers of its people.

Today, we will take a boat to this mysterious island to unravel the deep history of Hoto Shrine and the miraculous stories intertwined with it. This is a special pilgrimage that offers not just a boost in financial luck, but also peace of mind and new hope. Let's embark on this journey together now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】**

The main deity (主祭神, Shusaijin) enshrined at Hoto Shrine is a figure named **'Nozaki Okinokami Tsunayoshi (野崎隠岐守綱吉)'**. It is fascinating that he is not a grand god from Japanese mythology, but a real historical figure.

About 450 years ago, during the Sengoku (Warring States) period, he was a military commander who became a hero by protecting Takashima from the frequent invasions of pirates (Wokou). To honor his bravery and virtue, the islanders enshrined him as a deity. Today, he is revered not only as the island's guardian but also as a benevolent god who grants the wishes of worshippers.

While his blessings are widely known for 'financial luck' and 'winning luck,' they are deeply rooted in his spirit of 'protection' and 'benevolence' from when he wished for the peaceful lives of the people he guarded.

#### **【Origins and History: From Guardian to God of Miracles】**

The story of Hoto Shrine dates back to the blood-and-sweat-stained Sengoku period. In 1574, as the momentum for Japan's unification was building, Takashima was part of the territory of a local clan ruling the Hizen region. However, due to its coastal location, the island's peace was constantly threatened by the rampant piracy of the time. The one dispatched to protect the island was Nozaki Tsunayoshi.

With outstanding martial skill and strategy, he repelled the pirates and brought peace to the island. The islanders sincerely respected and followed him, and after his death, they built a small shrine to enshrine his spirit so as not to forget his grace. This was the beginning of Hoto Shrine. For centuries, Hoto Shrine remained a simple and devout center of faith for the people of Takashima, who prayed for bountiful catches, maritime safety, and family health, quietly continuing its history alongside their lives.

**So how did a shrine dedicated to the guardian of this small island become renowned throughout Japan as the ultimate 'power spot for financial luck'?**

The turning point came in the relatively recent past. The miracle began with the shrine's name, '宝当 (Hoto)'. Originally derived from the island's place name with no special meaning, its kanji characters could be interpreted as a fortuitous phrase: 'treasures (宝) are certain to (当) be won.'

In the 1990s, an island resident bought a lottery ticket for fun and prayed for a win at the shrine every day. Astonishingly, he hit a large jackpot. The story quietly spread across the island, and when the village chief also won the lottery soon after, the 'divine power of Hoto Shrine' could no longer remain an island secret.

Introduced by media as "the shrine where you can win the lottery," Hoto Shrine's name spread across Japan in an instant. A small shrine in an ordinary fishing village was transformed into a sacred place where people flocked with dreams of striking it rich.

However, it is important to remember that the essence of Hoto Shrine is not solely about 'money.' At its roots lie the respect and gratitude for a hero who sacrificed himself to protect his community. Perhaps the good fortune we receive at the shrine today is a reward for that noble spirit, a merciful gift from the deity to those who have crossed the sea with heartfelt wishes.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The journey to Hoto Shrine begins with a boat ride from Karatsu Port to Takashima. Although it's a short 10-minute trip, it feels like a ritual of purification, leaving the hustle and bustle of daily life behind to enter a sacred space. Upon arrival, the serene scenery of a fishing village greets you. A sense of excitement and reverence begins to build as you walk towards the shrine.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) & Hall of Worship (Haiden)**

Following the village path, you soon reach the entrance of Hoto Shrine. The shrine grounds are smaller and more modest than one might expect, but they emanate a unique energy, filled with *ema* (votive plaques) and flags bearing the wishes of worshippers from all over the country.

Standing before the Hall of Worship (Haiden), you first offer your prayers according to the prescribed etiquette. With 'two bows, two claps, and one bow' (二礼二拍手一礼), you silently convey your wishes. A distinctive feature here is the large box in front of the Haiden, where many people place their lottery tickets or business cards while praying. It's a space where you can feel the earnest desire for one's efforts to meet divine favor. The Main Hall (Honden) sits behind it, the most sacred place where the deity Nozaki Tsunayoshi is enshrined. It is not ornate, but it carries the weight and dignity of having protected the island for centuries.

#### **The Symbolic Torii and Worshipper's Path**

The *torii* (鳥居) gate of Hoto Shrine stands facing the village with its back to the sea. This seems to signify the deity welcoming visitors from across the water while simultaneously watching over the village and the entire island. The moment you pass through this *torii*, you enter the sacred realm of the god. The path is lined with numerous banners and letters of gratitude from past winners, vividly testifying to the shrine's miraculous power. It's a unique experience to see the joy of others and feel your own hopes for your wishes grow stronger.

#### **Hidden Gems & Power Spots**

There are a few places that are essential to a visit to Hoto Shrine, perhaps as important as praying at the main hall itself.

**1. Shioya Shrine (塩屋神社) on the Urasando (裏参道)**
The small path behind the Hoto Shrine's main hall, the 'Urasando' (rear path), is said to be the original path to the shrine. Following this path leads to a shop called 'Shioya (塩屋),' which is more than just a souvenir shop. It is run by a descendant of the very first lottery winner, and inside the shop, a small altar, 'Shioya Shrine,' is enshrined.

After praying at Hoto Shrine's main hall, many worshippers make a point to stop here to offer another prayer. It's famously believed that storing your lottery ticket in the yellow **'Hoto Fukuro (宝当袋)'** (Treasure Pouch) sold here increases your chances of winning. Although not officially part of the shrine grounds, this place is considered a powerful spot as the 'origin point' where the story of miracles began.

**2. Fuku-chan (福ちゃん), the Luck-Bringing Cat**
Around the Shioya shop, there is a mascot cat named 'Fuku-chan.' It is said that petting this cat, often seen lazily sunbathing or strolling among worshippers, brings good luck. Many people seek out Fuku-chan. Thanks to its gentle nature, it doesn't shy away from being petted. If you are lucky enough to meet Fuku-chan, gently stroke it and wish for good fortune. This encounter with a living *maneki-neko* (beckoning cat) will add a bit of fun and warmth to your trip.

**3. The Tomb of Nozaki Tsunayoshi (野崎綱吉の墓)**
On a hill a short distance from the shrine lies the tomb of the enshrined deity, Nozaki Tsunayoshi. Not many worshippers make their way here, but if you truly respect the shrine's origins and history, it is highly recommended. Offering a direct message of thanks to the hero who protected the island provides a deeper, more meaningful worship experience than simply asking for blessings. Taking a moment on the quiet hill overlooking the sea to reflect on the noble spirit of the samurai who defended this land 450 years ago is a profoundly moving experience in itself.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets (Juyohin): Proof of Your Pilgrimage

*Goshuin* and *juyohin* (amulets) that help you cherish the memory of your visit are another joy of shrine pilgrimages. Hoto Shrine is full of special items befitting its name.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The *goshuin* of Hoto Shrine is very direct and powerful. In the center, the name **'宝当神社'** is written in bold, energetic calligraphy, with the shrine's red seal (朱印) stamped clearly above it. While it lacks ornate decorations, the strong impression of its name, meaning 'treasures will be won,' makes it a worthy keepsake. Just receiving this *goshuin* feels like you are taking home a powerful aura of financial luck. The date of your visit is also inscribed, making it a precious memento of your visit to this special island.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

Hoto Shrine and the surrounding shops offer a variety of lucky charms and souvenirs to bring good fortune.

- **Hoto Fukuro (宝当袋)**
  This is by far the most popular item. It is said that placing lottery tickets, bank passbooks, or personal seals in this pouch, typically made of yellow cloth symbolizing luck, will boost your financial fortune. The original Hoto Fukuro sold at the Shioya shop is particularly popular, and it comes in various sizes and designs.

- **Atarimasu Strap (当たりますストラップ)**
  This is a small strap-style charm inscribed with the phrase 'Atarimasu (当たります),' meaning 'You will win.' It's easy to attach to a phone or bag, making it a popular and casual gift. Though small, this charm serves as a positive affirmation every time you see it, helping you attract good luck.

- **Hoto Shrine Candy (宝当神社飴)**
  These candies, stamped with the shrine's name, make for a fun and lighthearted souvenir. You can share the lucky energy while enjoying a tasty treat, making them a perfect gift for colleagues or friends.
