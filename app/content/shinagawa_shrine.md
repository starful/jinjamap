  the Shogun's Chosen Sanctuary for Success and Prosperity
---

When I want to take a breath amidst the hustle and bustle of Tokyo and feel a spiritual energy that transcends time and space, I unhesitatingly make my way to **Shinagawa Shrine (品川神社)**.

Nestled among towering buildings, this place is more than just a religious facility; it's a potent power spot where the wishes of countless people, from Kamakura-period warriors to Edo-period shoguns and even us today, have layered upon one another. It is particularly famous for its 'Soryu Torii' (Double Dragon Torii), a rare sight even in Tokyo, and for having a 'Mount Fuji' in the middle of the city.

Today, join me as we open the gates of this historic shrine and delve deep into the abyss of myth and history it holds. For those who dream of success and prosperity, this will be an unforgettable journey you won't want to miss.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the gods enshrined there, the *Gosaishin* (御祭神). At the heart of Shinagawa Shrine reside three venerable deities.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

- **Ame-no-hirinome-no-mikoto (天之比理乃咩命)**
  The principal deity, a god who opens sea routes and governs maritime safety. Appearing in ancient Japanese mythology as a deity of the Izu region, this god has been deeply venerated as the guardian of those crossing the rough seas. It provides great strength to those praying for safety on the voyage of life.

- **Uganome-no-mikoto (宇賀之売命)**
  A grain god symbolizing abundance and food. More familiarly known to us as 'Oinari-san' (お稲荷さん), this is one of the central deities of the Inari faith, widely known for bringing business prosperity and financial luck. This power has supported the commercial prosperity of Tokyo.

- **Susanoo-no-mikoto (素盞嗚尊)**
  One of the most dynamic and powerful gods in Japanese mythology. As the hero deity who defeated the giant eight-headed serpent, Yamata no Orochi, he is revered as a god of warding off evil, preventing disasters, and dispelling plagues. He is a pioneering god who repels negative energy and opens new paths.

The combination of these three deities perfectly encompasses humanity's most fundamental desires: **'Safety in voyages (challenges),' 'A prosperous life (wealth),' and 'Protection from disaster (safety).'**

#### **【Origins and History: Where the Wishes of Warriors and Shoguns Dwell】**

The history of Shinagawa Shrine dates back over 800 years to the Kamakura period, when Japan was entering the age of the samurai.

In the year 1187, Minamoto no Yoritomo (源頼朝), who had emerged victorious from the Genpei War (源平合戦) and established the Kamakura shogunate, was consolidating his power base. He decided to enshrine the spirit of Ame-no-hirinome-no-mikoto from Awa Shrine (安房神社) in Awa Province (安房国, present-day southern Chiba Prefecture) here in Shinagawa. At the time, Shinagawa was a crucial gateway to the sea. Yoritomo enshrined the sea god here to pray for the safety of maritime traffic and the prosperity of the shogunate. This was more than a mere religious act; it was a powerful political statement of his intent to control the seas.

As time passed and the peaceful Edo period began after the Warring States period, the prestige of Shinagawa Shrine grew even greater. After Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川家康) established his shogunate in Edo, Shinagawa flourished as the first post town (宿場町) on the Tokaido (東海道), the most important road connecting Edo and Kyoto. Countless daimyo (大名) processions and travelers passed through, paying their respects at Shinagawa Shrine to pray for a safe journey.

The Tokugawa clan held Shinagawa Shrine in particularly high regard. The third shogun, Iemitsu (家光), rebuilt the shrine's main buildings (社殿) and dedicated a mask (天下一嘗の面), one of the shrine's symbols, elevating its status to an official prayer site (祈願所) for the shogunate. Much like Kan'ei-ji Temple (寛永寺), which protected the northeastern 'demon gate' (鬼門, Kimon) of Edo Castle, Shinagawa Shrine served as a vital spiritual defense line guarding the northern gateway to Edo.

Entering the Meiji era, Emperor Meiji designated the 'Tokyo Ten Shrines' (東京十社) to pray for the prosperity and peace of Tokyo, and Shinagawa Shrine was proudly selected as one of them. This meant its history and divine status were officially recognized by the Imperial Court, and it continues its legacy as one of Tokyo's representative shrines to this day.

### 2. 境内 Stroll: Sights and Power Spots

The moment you step into the grounds of Shinagawa Shrine, you can feel an extraordinary energy. As you climb the steep steps, leave the worldly hustle behind and begin your journey into this sacred space.

#### **【The Soryu Torii (双龍鳥居) - The Double Dragon Torii】**

This is something that absolutely cannot be missed when talking about Shinagawa Shrine, and indeed, one of the main reasons to visit. Standing at the bottom of the stairs before the worship hall, this torii is called the 'Soryu Torii' (双龍鳥居) and boasts a rare style of which only three exist in Tokyo (the others being at Mabashi Inari Shrine and Koenji Tenmangu).

Unlike a typical torii, the left and right pillars are intricately carved with dragons coiling their way up. A closer look reveals a deeper meaning.

- **Left Pillar (Ascending Dragon, 昇り龍)**: This dragon is ascending to the heavens. It symbolizes carrying a wish up to the gods.
- **Right Pillar (Descending Dragon, 降り龍)**: This dragon is descending from the heavens. It symbolizes a wish being granted and bringing that blessing down to earth.

Therefore, it is said that when you visit to pray, you should touch the left pillar of the ascending dragon while making your wish. On your way back, touch the right pillar of the descending dragon to express your gratitude, which is believed to enhance the blessings. The dynamic forms of these dragons alone make you feel a powerful energy for success.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

After climbing the steep stairs, the magnificent Worship Hall (拝殿) appears before you. The current shrine buildings were reconstructed in 1964 and beautifully showcase traditional shrine architecture. The roof is adorned with intricate carvings, exuding a sense of dignity and the passage of time.

Worship here follows the basic etiquette of 'Nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (two bows, two claps, one bow).

1. Quietly place a coin into the **offertory box (賽銭箱)**.
2. Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle **(二拝)**.
3. At chest height, **clap your hands twice (二拍手)**. (The proper form is to have your right hand slightly lower than your left!)
4. Put your hands together and pray earnestly.
5. Finally, bow deeply one more time at a 90-degree angle **(一拝)**.

Through this process, you show respect to the deity, purify your heart, and convey your wishes.

#### **【Fujizuka (富士塚): A Miniature Mount Fuji in Tokyo】**

Follow the path next to the main hall, and you will encounter the most surprising power spot on the grounds: the 'Fujizuka' (富士塚). A Fujizuka is an artificial mound created by followers of 'Fujiko' (富士講), a folk faith that worships Mount Fuji, for those who cannot make the actual pilgrimage to the mountain.

The Fujizuka at Shinagawa Shrine stands about 15 meters tall, is the **largest of its kind still existing in Tokyo**, and is designated as a National Important Tangible Folk Cultural Property. Like the actual climbing trail of Mount Fuji, it has markers for the '1st station (一合目)', '5th station (五合目)', and so on, with a small shrine at the summit.

Amazingly, it is believed that climbing this mound grants the **same spiritual blessings as climbing the real Mount Fuji**. Standing at the summit and looking out over the Shinagawa area, though the altitude is low, you can have a special experience of accomplishment and a sense of sacred energy enveloping your entire body. On the mountain opening day (お山開き) on July 1st each year, many people visit to pray for health and the fulfillment of their wishes for the year.

#### **【Hidden Gems and Power Spots】**

- **Ana Inari Shrine (阿那稲荷神社)**
  Next to the entrance of the Fujizuka is a small subsidiary shrine (末社) called Ana Inari Shrine. It is divided into an Upper Shrine (上社) and a Lower Shrine (下社). The Lower Shrine is particularly mystical, as it is enshrined within a small cave. Legend says a sacred spring once flowed here, known as the **'Ichiryu Manbai' (一粒萬倍, one grain becomes ten thousand) spring**, believed to be effective for financial luck and business prosperity. It is a hidden gem where many people come to pray quietly and receive the water.

- **Sazare-ishi (さざれ石)**
  This is the very type of stone mentioned in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem, 'Kimigayo' (君が代). Like the verse "Until tiny pebbles grow into a massive boulder, covered in moss," this sacred stone symbolizes long life, unity, and prosperity. The quiet presence of this national symbol within the shrine grounds is deeply moving in itself.

- **Hochozuka (包丁塚)**
  This is a mound erected to give thanks to old kitchen knives used by chefs. It is an interesting spot that offers a glimpse into the unique Japanese culture of showing gratitude and respect even to tools.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms (授与品): A Proof of Your Visit

The goshuin and omamori, which allow you to cherish the memory of your visit, are another joy of a shrine pilgrimage.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Shinagawa Shrine is very popular as it encapsulates its historical background.

- **Center**: The shrine's name, 'Shinagawa Jinja' (品川神社), is written in powerful calligraphy.
- **Top Right**: The phrase 'Tokai Chingo' (東海鎮護) is often written. This means 'Guardian Protector of the Eastern Sea,' symbolizing the shrine's origin, founded by Minamoto no Yoritomo to pray for maritime safety.
- **Bottom Left**: A seal with 'Tokaido Dai-ichi Shuku' (東海道第一宿) may be stamped. This is a historical mark certifying that this was the first post town on the Tokaido road.

During special times like New Year's or the annual grand festival (例大祭), you can receive limited-edition goshuin, so it's a good idea to check the official website before visiting.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) and Engimono (縁起物) - Amulets and Lucky Charms】**

Shinagawa Shrine has many unique and reportedly powerful omamori.

- **Ichiryu Manbai Omamori (一粒萬倍お守り)**
  This amulet, meaning "A single grain of rice will return ten thousandfold," is known to have the ultimate efficacy for financial luck and business prosperity. It is especially popular among those starting a business or making an investment.
- **Wish Fulfillment Soryu Omamori (祈願達成双龍守)**
  This amulet is modeled after the shrine's symbol, the Soryu Torii. It is said to help you achieve your goals and fulfill your wishes by channeling the powerful energy of the ascending and descending dragons.
- **Fujizuka Climbing Commemorative Omamori (富士塚登拝記念御守)**
  This amulet commemorates climbing the Fujizuka and allows you to take home the sacred energy of Mount Fuji. It is believed to be effective for health and wish fulfillment.
