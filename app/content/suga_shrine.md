Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, we journey to the Izumo region of Shimane Prefecture, the heartland of Japanese mythology. Among its countless shrines, our focus is on a place with the glorious title of **'Japan's First Palace (日本初之宮)'**: **Suga Shrine (須賀神社)**.

This is the newlywed home built by the hero Susanoo, who defeated a monstrous serpent, to live with his beautiful wife, Kushinadahime. It is also the romantic spot where 'Waka,' the progenitor of Japanese literature, was first composed.
Shall we take a journey back in time together into this forest, where the decisiveness and poignant love story of a mythical hero come to life?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Defeating a Monster to Win Love

The story of Suga Shrine is like a heroic epic.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Susanoo and Kushinadahime】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Susanoo-no-Mikoto**. He is the god of storms and the sea, a rough but righteous hero.
Enshrined alongside him is **Kushinadahime**, the beautiful goddess he rescued and made his wife. And their son, **Yashimajinumi-no-Kami**, is also worshipped, making them a complete family of gods.
Therefore, this shrine is known to have powerful blessings for **'marital harmony,'** **'matchmaking (Enmusubi),'** and **'warding off evil (Yakuyoke).'**

#### **【Origins and History: "Ah, I Feel So Refreshed!"】**

Exiled from the heavens, Susanoo came to the land of Izumo and heard tales of the **'Yamata-no-Orochi,'** an eight-headed monster that devoured a maiden every year. He intoxicated the monster with strong sake, defeated it with his divine sword, and saved Kushinadahime, who was to be the final sacrifice.

The hero wandered in search of a place to live with his wife and, upon arriving here, exclaimed, **"My heart feels truly refreshed (sugasugashii)."** That is how this place came to be named 'Suga,' and the palace he built became the origin of Suga Shrine.

The poem he composed at that moment, **"Yakumo tatsu..." (Eight clouds rise...)**, is recorded as Japan's first fixed-form poem (waka), making this the **'birthplace of Waka poetry.'** It's a song filled with his heartfelt desire to build a fence for his beloved wife.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: In Search of the Mythical Couple's Traces

The grounds of Suga Shrine are tranquil and filled with a sacred aura. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Main Hall and Its Unique Architecture**

Suga Shrine's main hall (honden) has a unique structure with three sanctuaries connected side-by-side. The central one enshrines Susanoo, while the ones on either side are for his wife and son, symbolizing a harmonious family.

#### **The Couple Rocks (Meoto Iwa) and the Giant Camphor Tree**

Behind the main hall stand two rocks, one large and one small, side-by-side. These are the **'Couple Rocks.'** A giant camphor tree extends its branches as if to protect them, adding to the mystical atmosphere. If you're here with a loved one, it's the perfect spot to promise everlasting love.

#### **The Waka Birthplace Monument**

On the grounds, there is a stone monument inscribed with the waka poem said to have been composed by Susanoo. How about embracing the poetic spirit and reciting a verse at the very origin of Japanese literature?

#### **Okunoin (Inner Sanctuary): Into the Primeval Forest**

About 2 km from the shrine, on the mountainside, lies the **'Okunoin.'** This is the original site where Suga-no-miya was first built, and three giant cedar trees stand there, symbolizing the deities. The path can be a bit challenging, but it is the ultimate power spot where you can feel the potent energy emanating from the primeval forest.
