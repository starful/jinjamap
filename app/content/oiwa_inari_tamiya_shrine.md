### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: From Folklore to Fortune

**Oiwa Inari Tamiya Shrine (於岩稲荷田宮神社)** in Shinkawa is a site where Japanese urban legend meets historical reality. For many, the name "Oiwa" immediately conjures images of the vengeful ghost from the famous Kabuki play, *Tokaido Yotsuya Kaidan*. However, the truth preserved at this shrine tells a much more inspiring story.

**The Real Oiwa-sama**
The shrine is dedicated to **Oiwa-no-Mikoto**, a real woman who lived in the early Edo period (died 1636). Contrary to the tragic figure portrayed on stage, the historical Oiwa was a woman of exceptional virtue. She and her husband, Tamiya Iemon, were known for their tireless work and devotion to the Inari deity, which led to the miraculous revival of the Tamiya family's fortunes. Neighbors began to worship her small home shrine, calling it "Oiwa Inari," believing that following her example of faith would bring prosperity to their own households.

**The Shinkawa Connection**
While the original shrine is in Yotsuya, this Shinkawa branch has a deep-rooted history. During the late Edo period, the Tamiya family maintained a secondary residence in Shinkawa due to its proximity to the Shogunate’s strategic warehouses. In 1879 (Meiji 12), after a fire destroyed the Yotsuya site and following the immense popularity of Kabuki plays featuring Oiwa, the shrine was officially relocated to Shinkawa to accommodate the many actors and fans from the nearby entertainment districts of Nihonbashi and Ningyocho. Today, it remains a "mecca" for Kabuki actors who visit to pay their respects before performing any play related to Oiwa.
