Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll guide you to Kamakura, an ancient capital surrounded by sea and mountains, just an hour from Tokyo. While there are countless temples and shrines, the beginning and end of any trip to Kamakura is undoubtedly here, at **'Tsurugaoka Hachimangu (鶴岡八幡宮)'**.

Founded by 'Minamoto no Yoritomo,' the founder of the Kamakura Shogunate, this shrine was the guardian deity of the samurai and the heart of the city. From the majestic red main shrine and the stone steps steeped in tragic history, to the approach path where cherry blossoms flutter, this is a place where you can feel the fervent spirit of the samurai from 800 years ago, going beyond simple sightseeing.

For those who wish to pray for victory and success, and for those seeking a deep historical journey, let's head to this symbol of Kamakura together now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The God of Victory Worshipped by Samurai

Before you pass through the red torii gate of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, let's first learn about the deities enshrined here and the history behind them.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Hachiman-ōkami】**

This shrine is dedicated to three deities: **Emperor Ōjin (god of martial arts)**, **Himegami**, and **Empress Jingū**. Collectively, they are known as **'Hachiman-ōkami'**.
Emperor Ōjin, in particular, was known as the 'god of the bow and arrow' and was absolutely revered by the samurai. Beyond victory in war, for modern people, he is known as a powerful deity who brings **certain victory (必勝)**, **success in exams**, and **business success**. If you're at a critical juncture in your life, receive the energy of the god Hachiman here.

#### **【Origins and History: The Heart of the Kamakura Shogunate】**

In 1180, the head of the Genji clan, **Minamoto no Yoritomo**, entered Kamakura and began preparations to establish his shogunate. The first thing he did was to move this shrine, which enshrined his ancestral deity, to the center of the city and build it on a grand scale. The city was designed and roads were built with the shrine at its core, so it's no exaggeration to say that Kamakura itself was a city created for Hachimangu.

However, this place is not only a site of glory but also of tragedy. The stone steps in front of the main shrine are where the third shogun, Minamoto no Sanetomo, was assassinated by his own nephew. The history of this place, where the desire for power and its transience coexist, resonates deeply with visitors.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Scenic View Woven by History and Nature

From the path leading from Kamakura Station to the shrine, to various spots within the grounds, here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Dankazura (段葛)**

In the center of the approach path leading from the station to the shrine is a raised walkway called the **'Dankazura'**. This path was built by Yoritomo to pray for the safe delivery of his wife, Masako. In spring, it becomes a tunnel of cherry blossoms, creating a fantastical scene.

#### **Maiden (Stage) & Ōicho (Great Ginkgo Tree)**

The **'Maiden'** (stage) in the center of the grounds is where the tragic lady Shizuka Gozen danced while longing for her lover, Yoshitsune. Today, it is a popular wedding venue. Next to it are the remains of the 1,000-year-old **Great Ginkgo Tree**. Although it was toppled by a typhoon, new shoots have sprouted from its roots, showing its powerful life force.

#### **Hongū (Main Shrine) and the Dove Plaque**

After climbing 61 stone steps, the magnificent vermilion **Hongū (Main Shrine)** appears. From here, you can overlook the city of Kamakura and the sea, feeling a sense of noble spirit. If you look closely at the characters for **'Hachimangu (八幡宮)'** on the main shrine's plaque, you'll see that the character '八' (hachi) is depicted as two doves facing each other. This is because doves are the messengers of the god Hachiman.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Keeping a Token of Victory

Here are some special items to help you cherish the memory of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu is characterized by its powerful calligraphy and a dove-shaped stamp. You can receive a goshuin not only from the main shrine but also from the 'Shirahatasha Shrine' (which enshrines Yoritomo) within the grounds. If you're a history fan, be sure to get both.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Charm (Kachimamori)**: This is a charm for certain victory, imbued with the spirit of the samurai. The gold lettering on a black background is striking. It's the perfect gift for students taking exams or job seekers.
- **Dove Charm (Hatomamori)**: A cute, dove-shaped bell charm. It is said to bring good luck.
- **Hato Sablé**: Strictly speaking, it's not a shrine souvenir, but it's Kamakura's most famous specialty. These dove-shaped butter cookies are the number one must-buy souvenir at the shopping street in front of the shrine.
