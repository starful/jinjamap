### 🙏 Introduction: Deities & History

Nestled at the foot of the sacred Mount Hiei, overlooking the vast expanse of Lake Biwa, Hiyoshi Taisha (日吉大社) is a shrine of immense historical and spiritual significance. It is not merely a single sanctuary but a sprawling complex of over forty shrines, serving as the head shrine for approximately 3,800 Sannō and Hiyoshi shrines across Japan. Its story is deeply intertwined with the powerful Enryaku-ji temple complex on the mountain above, the ancient capital of Kyoto, and a unique divine messenger: the monkey.

The primary deities enshrined here are Oyamakui-no-Kami (大山咋神), venerated in the East Palace (Higashi Hongū), and Omononushi-no-Kami (大物主神), worshipped in the West Palace (Nishi Hongū). Oyamakui-no-Kami is the original god of Mount Hiei, an ancient mountain deity who has been revered here since time immemorial. The story of the West Palace is tied to the 1st-century Emperor Tenji, who moved the capital to Ōtsu. During this time, the great deity of Mount Miwa in Nara, Omononushi-no-Kami, was invited here to protect the new capital, establishing the second pillar of the shrine's faith.

However, the shrine's identity was most profoundly shaped by its relationship with Buddhism. When the monk Saichō established the Tendai Buddhist school headquarters, Enryaku-ji, on Mount Hiei in 788, Hiyoshi Taisha was designated as its guardian shrine. This led to a fascinating syncretism of Shinto and Buddhist beliefs known as *Sannō Shintō* (山王神道). The kami of Hiyoshi were seen as local manifestations, or avatars, of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Oyamakui-no-Kami, the "Mountain King" (Sannō), was identified with Yakushi Nyorai (the Medicine Buddha), and Omononushi-no-Kami with Shaka Nyorai (the historical Buddha).

This sacred mountain, Hiei, stands to the northeast of Kyoto, a direction traditionally known as the *kimon* (鬼門), or "demon gate"—an unlucky direction from which evil spirits were believed to enter. Hiyoshi Taisha, along with Enryaku-ji, served as the spiritual protectors of the capital, guarding this vulnerable gateway for centuries.

The shrine's most charming feature is its divine familiar, the monkey, or *Masaru* (神猿). This reverence stems from a clever play on words. The character for monkey (猿) can be read as "*saru*," which is a homophone for the word "to leave" or "to banish" (去る). Thus, the divine monkey is believed to banish evil and misfortune (魔が去る, *ma ga saru*). The name *Masaru* (勝る) also means "to win" or "to be superior," making the monkeys symbols of victory and success. This sacred connection is celebrated throughout the shrine grounds, where you’ll find statues and motifs of these beloved messengers.

### ⛩️ Exploring the Grounds

A visit to Hiyoshi Taisha is a journey into a deep, mystical forest. The grounds are vast, bisected by the Omiya River, and shaded by towering, ancient cedar trees that seem to touch the heavens. The air is cool and still, filled with the gentle sound of the flowing river and the whispers of history. The shrine is primarily divided into two main precincts: the Higashi Hongū (East Palace) and the Nishi Hongū (West Palace).

Your journey begins as you pass under the iconic **Sannō Torii**. This gate is unlike any other in Japan. It features a distinctive triangular gable, known as a *gasshō* (合掌), placed atop the main crossbeam, resembling two hands pressed together in prayer. This unique design immediately signals that you are entering a place of special sanctity, a fusion of architectural and spiritual traditions.

As you walk, you will cross one of the **Three Great Bridges of Hiyoshi** (日吉三橋, Hiyoshi Sankyō). These elegant stone arch bridges—the Omiya-bashi, Hashiudo-bashi, and Sannō-bashi—are designated as Important Cultural Properties and add to the timeless beauty of the landscape.

The **Nishi Hongū (西本宮, West Palace)** is arguably the highlight of the shrine complex. Its main hall, or *Honden*, is a designated National Treasure and a masterpiece of shrine architecture. It is built in a unique style called *Hiyoshi-zukuri* (日吉造), sometimes also referred to as *Sannō-zukuri*. The building has a T-shaped floor plan with a distinctively long, low-sloping roof made of cypress bark. A special veranda runs around the front and sides of the building, while the rear chamber, connected to the main hall, has a lower floor level. This intricate and elegant design is found only here and at the subordinate shrines on the grounds. The hall is dedicated to Omononushi-no-Kami and is a breathtaking example of Momoyama-period reconstruction, ordered by the great warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi after the entire mountain complex was razed by Oda Nobunaga in 1571.

A short walk away lies the **Higashi Hongū (東本宮, East Palace)**, dedicated to the mountain god Oyamakui-no-Kami. While also rebuilt in the late 16th century, it feels even more ancient and deeply connected to the mountain itself. Its *Honden* is also built in the *Hiyoshi-zukuri* style and is an Important Cultural Property. The atmosphere here is profoundly serene, inviting quiet contemplation.

Don't miss the **Shin'en-sha (神猿舎)**, or Sacred Monkey Enclosure. Here, you can see live Japanese macaques, living embodiments of the divine *Masaru*. Watching them is a charming reminder of the shrine's unique faith and a favorite spot for visitors of all ages.

Beyond the two main palaces, the grounds are a treasure trove of smaller shrines, ancient trees, and stone lanterns draped in moss. Key auxiliary shrines include the Ushio-gu (牛尾宮) and Sannomiya-gu (三宮宮), whose *honden* are also National Treasures. The sheer scale and historical depth of the complex can be overwhelming; every path seems to lead to another piece of history, another quiet corner of devotion.

### 📜 Goshuin & Omamori

For collectors of spiritual mementos, Hiyoshi Taisha offers a delightful array of unique items that reflect its rich heritage.

The **Goshuin (御朱印)**, or honorable stamp, is a beautiful piece of calligraphy that serves as proof of your pilgrimage. Hiyoshi Taisha offers several designs. The main stamp, from the Nishi Hongū, proudly features the shrine's name and the date of your visit in bold, flowing script. Often, you can also get a special stamp featuring a stylized red ink drawing of the divine *Masaru* monkey or the iconic Sannō Torii, making it a particularly memorable keepsake.

The **Omamori (お守り)**, or protective amulets, are where the shrine's divine messengers truly shine. The most popular charms feature the *Masaru* monkey. You can find small, beautifully embroidered pouches with monkey designs, intended to bring victory (*shōun*, 勝運) and ward off evil (*mayoke*, 魔除け). One of the most sought-after items is the *Masaru-san* ceramic bell (*dorei*, 土鈴). This small, hand-painted clay bell is shaped like a seated monkey and is believed to protect the bearer from misfortune. Its gentle rattle is a comforting reminder of the shrine's protective power. Other charms are available for general good fortune, health, and safe travels, all imbued with the spirit of the sacred mountain and its cheerful guardians.
