### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

At the center of Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine, two main deities are enshrined: **Kanayamahiko-no-kami (金山毘古神)** and **Kanayamahime-no-kami (金山毘売神)**. In Japanese mythology, these two are gods who preside over mines and metals. As their names suggest, they possess a powerful divine nature imbued with the energy of "gold" (金).

As they govern all aspects of mining, smelting, and processing metals, they have been deeply worshipped by blacksmiths and miners since ancient times. In the modern era, they are widely known as gods of commercial prosperity, wealth accumulation, and, above all, powerful **increased financial luck (金運円満)**.

Furthermore, **Benzaiten (弁財天)**, one of the Seven Lucky Gods and the goddess of wealth, arts, and wisdom, is also enshrined here, giving visitors a deep sense of faith that no wish related to wealth will be ignored. The combination of these three deities is the core reason why Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine has established itself as one of Japan's leading shrines for financial fortune.

#### **【Origins and History】**

The story of this shrine's founding is intertwined with one of the most dramatic moments in ancient Japanese history. It dates back to the Nara period in the year 749, when Emperor Shōmu was commissioning the world's largest bronze Buddha statue, the "Great Buddha of Nara," at Tōdai-ji Temple in Nara.

While the casting of the statue was successful, the emperor had one major concern. He wished to gild the massive statue with gold to illuminate the Buddha's compassionate light throughout the world, but at the time, gold was not produced in Japan, making it impossible to acquire the vast amount needed.

Just then, news that was nothing short of a miracle reached the capital city of Nara. It was a joyful report that gold dust (砂金) had been discovered for the first time in Japanese history in Oda District, Mutsu Province (modern-day Tohoku region), at the eastern edge of the country. This was seen not merely as the discovery of a mineral, but as clear proof that the emperor's prayers had reached the gods and a blessing bestowed by them.

To commemorate this historic first discovery of gold and to express gratitude to the gods, a shrine was built on the sacred island of Kinkasan, close to where the gold was found, and the gods of mining were enshrined. This was the beginning of Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine. True to its name, which means "the mountain where golden flowers bloom (金華山)," this place was the very sacred ground that heralded the golden dawn of Japan's prosperity.

### 2. 境内 Stroll: Sights and Power Spots

The entire island of Kinkasan is a sacred precinct (神域). From the moment you step off the ferry, you can feel a clear, divine air, different from the secular world, enveloping your entire body. As you walk along the forest path where deer, considered divine messengers (神使), roam freely, the magnificent form of the shrine eventually unfolds before you.

#### **Main Hall (本殿) & Hall of Worship (拝殿)**

Climbing the steep stone steps, you will see the dignified Hall of Worship (拝殿). The current building was reconstructed during the Meiji era, but it features delicate and splendid carvings that offer a glimpse into the aesthetic sense of the Date clan. Here, offer your earnest prayers following the "two bows, two claps, one bow" (二拝二拍手一拝) etiquette.

#### **The Symbolic Torii and Approach Path**

The first torii gate on the path from the pier to the shrine, standing against the backdrop of the sea, is a symbolic gateway marking the beginning of the Kinkasan pilgrimage. The path, lined with giant cedar trees, offers a healing power that purifies the mind just by walking through it.

#### **Hidden Gems & Power Spots**

- **Zeniaraiba (銭洗い場, Money-Washing Place):** There is a legend that washing coins or bills in the sacred water flowing from a dragon's mouth will cause your money to multiply. Keep the washed money in your wallet as "seed money."
- **Benzaiten-gū Shrine (弁財天宮) and the Dragon God (龍神):** This is where Benzaiten, the goddess of water and wealth, is enshrined. You can feel the powerful energy of the dragon god, making it a great place to pray for business prosperity.
- **The Okunomiya (奥の宮) at the Summit:** An inner shrine located at the 445-meter peak. It requires about a 90-minute hike, but you can offer prayers closest to the gods while enjoying a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean.
