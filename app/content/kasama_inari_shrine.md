Today, I'd like to guide you to a special place nestled in the peaceful scenery of Kasama City, Ibaraki Prefecture. It is **Kasama Inari Shrine (笠間稲荷神社)**, one of the most distinguished among the 30,000 Inari shrines across Japan, known as one of **"Japan's Three Great Inari Shrines (日本三大稲荷)"**.

This place is more than just a site for worship; it is a living history that has embraced the earnest wishes of countless people for over 1,370 years. Let's embark on a pilgrimage together to this mystical space where myth and reality intersect, at the heart of the Inari faith that prays for abundance and prosperity.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

To understand why Kasama Inari Shrine is called a sacred site for "business prosperity," we must first look at the deity enshrined here and its origins.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】**

The deity enshrined in the deepest part of Kasama Inari Shrine is **Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto (宇迦之御魂神)**.

In Japanese mythology, this deity is known as the ruler of grains and food. The word 'Uka (宇迦)' in the name itself means grain and food. In ancient Japan, where agriculture was the foundation of the nation, governing the food that sustained life was a symbol of the most fundamental power and abundance, directly linked to survival.

As times changed and society shifted from being agriculturally centered to commercially and industrially focused, the deity's role expanded. Today, Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto is worshipped not only for agriculture but also as a deity who presides over all industries that enrich human life, including **commercial prosperity, industrial development, household safety, traffic safety, and bountiful fishing**.

This is why millions of worshippers visit each year to pray for their own business success and fruitful outcomes. Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto is a familiar yet powerful deity who listens to our most universal and warm-hearted desires for a life that is both materially and spiritually abundant.

#### **【Origins and History: The Legend Under the Walnut Tree】**

The history of Kasama Inari Shrine dates back to 651 (the second year of the Hakuchi era, 白雉二年), at the end of the Asuka period. Its beginning is as mystical as a folktale.

At that time, the local clan chief, Nunoi-no-miya (布衣の宮), had a strange dream one night. In the dream, a radiant old man with white hair appeared, identified himself as 'Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto,' and delivered a divine oracle:

> "If you enshrine me at the foot of Mount Mikasayama (御笠山), where the walnut tree stands, the people will be blessed with abundance, and this land will prosper forever."

Awakening from the dream, Nunoi-no-miya rushed to the place indicated by the oracle as soon as dawn broke. To his amazement, a giant walnut tree truly stood there, and from beneath it, two white foxes appeared amid a mystical light. Convinced that this was the will of the gods, he built a small shrine (祠) on the spot and reverently enshrined the deity. This is the origin of Kasama Inari Shrine. Because of this legend, the shrine is also known by the nickname **"Inari Under the Walnut Tree"**.

The shrine's fame gradually spread, and by the Kamakura period, its status was further elevated when Kasama Tokitomo (笠間時朝), the lord of the Kasama region, moved the shrine to its current location and dedicated a magnificent new sanctuary. During the Edo period, successive lords (藩主) of the Kasama domain worshipped the shrine as the domain's guardian deity. In particular, the lords of the Makino clan (牧野家) are said to have always stopped here to pray for the domain's peace and prosperity whenever they traveled to Edo Castle.

Of course, there were trials. In 1860 (the first year of the Man'en era), the shrine suffered a tragedy when a great fire destroyed most of its buildings, including the main hall. However, the faith of the people, built over hundreds of years, was stronger than the flames. Not only the domain lord at the time, Makino Sadanae, but also local residents and even worshippers from distant Edo joined forces to rebuild. They finally succeeded in restoring the majestic and beautiful shrine we see today. This reconstruction process was more than just an act of construction; it is a moving history that demonstrates the people's unwavering faith in their deity and the unity of the community.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

With every step you take through the grounds of Kasama Inari Shrine, a sacred energy and beautiful scenery captivate the heart. Here are the main attractions within the precincts, where the architectural beauty of the Edo period harmonizes with nature.

#### **【Main Hall (本殿) & Worship Hall (拝殿)】**

The Worship Hall (拝殿), standing majestically at the center of the precincts, is the first place to greet visitors. Rebuilt after the great fire of the mid-19th century, this building is a masterpiece showcasing the essence of late-Edo period shrine architecture and is designated as a **National Important Cultural Property**.

The most noteworthy features are the **exquisite and ornate carvings (彫刻)** that adorn the eaves of the Worship Hall and the Main Hall. Created by the top craftsmen of the time, these carvings are also called the "treasure of Kasama." Auspicious animals and plants such as dragons, peonies, and phoenixes are depicted with such lifelike dynamism that they seem ready to move at any moment, leaving viewers spellbound.

Worship is conducted in the standard Shinto manner of "two bows, two claps, one bow" (二拝二拍手一拝). The sound of clapping that echoes in the quiet silence is a sacred signal to announce your presence to the deity and convey the deepest wishes of your heart.

#### **【Natural Monument Wisteria Trellis (藤棚)】**

Another symbol of Kasama Inari Shrine is the two giant wisteria trees located next to the Worship Hall. Called **"Yae-no-fuji (八重の藤)"** and **"Ōfuji (大藤)"**, these ancient trees are over 400 years old and have been designated as Natural Monuments of Ibaraki Prefecture.

Every year in early May, these wisteria trees pour forth cascades of pale purple blossoms. The sweet, profound fragrance that fills the precincts and the dreamlike violet scenery that unfolds before your eyes provide an unforgettable experience for all who visit. The resilient life force of the wisteria, which has withstood the elements for ages and blooms beautifully each year, is itself considered a "power spot" that emanates a strong energy.

#### **【East Gate (東門) and Tower Gate (楼門)】**

The Tower Gate (楼門), which serves as the main entrance to the shrine, was built in 1961 and is known as **Japan's largest stone Inari gate**. As you step into the precincts, overwhelmed by its grand scale, you feel as though you are crossing the boundary between the everyday and the sacred.

However, another gate not to be missed is the **East Gate (東門)**. Rebuilt in 1861, this gate is a precious structure designated as a National Important Cultural Property along with the Main and Worship Halls. While it may appear relatively modest, you can feel the artisan's touch in its wooden structure and delicate decorations, which bear the marks of time. This gate is particularly significant as it is located to the east, which symbolizes the "creation and development of all things," holding special meaning for those starting new businesses or praying for growth.

#### **【Hidden Gems: Seitokuden Hall (聖徳殿) and Fox Statues】**

Deeper within the precincts is the **Seitokuden Hall (聖徳殿)**, which enshrines Prince Shōtoku (聖徳太子). Prince Shōtoku is revered as the progenitor of Japanese crafts and technological development. For this reason, it is a hidden gem for people working in technical fields such as architecture, civil engineering, and crafts, who come to pray for business success and technical improvement.

You can also find statues of **foxes (狐, kitsune)**, the messengers (使者) of the Inari deity, throughout the grounds. The figures of foxes holding sheaves of rice, keys, or scrolls in their mouths symbolize abundance, the opening of storehouses (wealth), and wisdom, respectively. It's a great pleasure to look for these fox statues, which are believed to be spiritual beings that convey worshippers' wishes to the deity, and imagine the meaning behind their expressions and postures.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets (授与品): Proof of Your Visit

The Goshuin and Omamori, which make the memory of your visit even more special, are precious tokens of your connection with the deity.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kasama Inari Shrine is famous for its very neat and elegant calligraphy. In the center, the shrine's name, **'笠間稲荷神社'** (Kasama Inari Jinja), is boldly written in black ink, with the shrine's crest in the upper right and the red shrine seal stamped clearly in the middle. In its simplicity, one can feel the weight and dignity of its 1,370-year history.

During special periods, such as the 'Tsutsuji Matsuri' (Azalea Festival) in early May when the wisteria flowers are in full bloom, or during the autumn Chrysanthemum Festival, the shrine may offer **limited edition goshuin** with special stamps symbolizing the season. If your travel dates align, I highly recommend receiving this special proof of your pilgrimage.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

As Kasama Inari Shrine is renowned for its blessings of business prosperity, it offers a wide variety of related omamori (amulets) and engimono (lucky charms).

- **Business Prosperity Amulet (商売繁昌守)**: This is the most popular amulet for business owners or those embarking on a new venture. Ornately decorated with gold embroidery, simply carrying this amulet can give you a sense of powerful support.
- **Fox Fortune (きつねみくじ)**: A unique omikuji where a fortune paper is tucked inside a cute white ceramic fox figurine. After checking your fortune, you can keep the little fox as a small decoration, making it a popular souvenir.
- **Wisteria Amulet (藤守)**: An amulet embroidered with the beautiful wisteria flowers that symbolize the shrine. It is said to bring blessings for good relationships and smooth interpersonal connections.
- **Traffic Safety Sticker**: This sticker features a unique design of a fox, the messenger of the Inari deity. It is believed to protect you on the road when affixed to a car.
