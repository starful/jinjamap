Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a place in the middle of a residential area in Kyoto that emanates a mystical aura. It is **'Seimei Shrine (晴明神社)'**, built on the former residential site of the legendary Onmyoji, **'Abe no Seimei,'** whom you may only know as a protagonist in movies or anime.

Here, the shrine's symbol, the **'star shape (pentagram),'** is engraved everywhere, making you feel as if you've entered a barrier in another dimension the moment you step inside. From a peach statue that wards off evil spirits to a mysterious well that cures illnesses.
This place became even more famous after figure skater Hanyu Yuzuru visited to pray for victory. Why not visit and receive the powerful energy of 'victory' and 'warding off evil' for yourself?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Genius Onmyoji Who Read the Stars and Ruled the Spirits

The mystique of Seimei Shrine stems from the legendary life of its master, Abe no Seimei.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Abe no Seimei】**

The enshrined deity here is **Abe no Seimei**. He was a real astronomer and Onmyoji during the Heian period who predicted the nation's fortunes and prevented disasters based on the cutting-edge science of his time, astronomy and the Yin-Yang Five Elements theory.
Thanks to his superhuman abilities, he was deified after his death and is believed to exert powerful influence, especially for **'warding off evil (yakuyoke),'** **'demon dispelling (mayoke),'** and **'victory/success (shoun).'**

#### **【Origins and History: Son of a Fox, Became a God】**

There is a mystical birth legend about Seimei that "his mother was a white fox from the forest." Stories of him having the ability to see spirits from a young age and freely commanding shikigami (spirit servants) show what an extraordinary figure he was.
When he passed away in 1005, Emperor Ichijo, to honor his great achievements, had a shrine built on the site of his mansion. A thousand years later, this place remains a spiritual fortress protecting Kyoto.

### 2. ⭐ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Into the Pentagram's Barrier

The grounds are small, but filled with traces of the Onmyoji at every turn. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Ichino Torii and the Pentagram**

At the shrine's entrance, a golden **'pentagram (star)'** shines in the center of the stone torii. It is very rare to see a star where a shrine's name is usually written. This pentagram is also called the 'Seimei Kikyo' (Seimei Bellflower) and symbolizes the harmony of the five elements and a charm to repel evil.

#### **Ichijo Modoribashi Bridge and Shikigami Statue**

After passing the torii, you'll find a small bridge and a cute(?) demon stone statue next to it. This is a recreation of the legendary bridge, **'Ichijo Modoribashi,'** where Seimei was said to have hidden his shikigami (spirit servants).

#### **Seimei Well (Seimei-i)**

Next to the main hall is a well that Seimei is said to have brought forth with his psychic powers.

- **Features**: It is known as miraculous water that cures illnesses. The spout from which the water flows is turned to face the auspicious direction (eho) of the year every Risshun (the first day of spring). It's very popular as a phone wallpaper, with rumors that it brings good luck.

#### **Warding Peach (Yakuyoke-momo)**

In front of the main hall stands a shiny peach statue.

- **Experience**: Rub the peach to transfer your uneasy feelings or bad energy to it. The peach has been considered a fruit that wards off evil since ancient times. You will feel much lighter in spirit.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Capturing the Power of the Stars

The amulets and souvenirs from Seimei Shrine are unique and stylish, featuring the pentagram.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Seimei Shrine is simple yet powerful. The Goshuin, with its red **pentagram** stamp, feels like a potent charm in itself.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Charm (Kachimamori)**: The same charm that Hanyu Yuzuru carried! It has the power to help you win in battles against yourself or in important competitions.
- **Pentagram Sticker Charm**: A sticker with the star shape. Placing it on your entrance, car, or phone will ward off bad luck.
- **Bellflower Charm**: A limited-edition charm available only from May to September when the bellflowers are in bloom.
