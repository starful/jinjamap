title: 'Yoshida Shrine, the Forest That Changed the History of Japanese Shinto: In
  Search of the Ultimate Power Spot Where Eight Million Gods Gather'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' where we introduce profound sacred sites from around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a hidden gem in Kyoto, **'Yoshida Shrine (吉田神社)'**. While not a bustling tourist spot like Kinkaku-ji or Kiyomizu-dera, this is a historic site that left a monumental mark on Japan's spiritual history and is the ultimate power spot where you can meet the eight million gods of Japan in one place.

Starting as a guardian shrine of Heian-kyo a thousand years ago, it became the center of Shinto. As you walk along the forest path, you can also encounter unique gods closely related to our daily lives, such as the god of cooking and the god of confections. Shall we journey together to feel the profound echo of history in this serene forest?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Revolutionaries Who Changed Shinto History

The true value of Yoshida Shrine shines even brighter when you understand its historical background.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Guardian Gods of the Fujiwara Clan】**

This shrine enshrines the **Kasuga-no-kami (four deities)**. They are the same gods as those at Kasuga Taisha in Nara and are the clan deities of the Fujiwara family, who were the most powerful figures during the Heian period.

- **Takemikazuchi & Futsunushi**: Martial gods who pacified the country, they aid in **national peace** and **success**.
- **Ame-no-Koyane**: The god of wisdom and prayers, overseeing **academic achievement** and **career advancement**.
- **Himegami**: A goddess who protects **marital harmony** and **peace**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Birth of Yoshida Shinto】**

Yoshida Shrine was founded in 859 to protect the northeastern "demon gate" (kimon) of Heian-kyo (Kyoto). However, it was the Muromachi period priest **'Yoshida Kanetomo'** who made this place the center of Japanese religious history.
He founded **'Yoshida Shinto' (Yuiitsu Shinto)**, which overturned the Buddhist-centric worldview by declaring, "The gods are the foundation of the universe." He then declared that all the gods of the nation were gathered here, making Yoshida Shrine the head shrine of all Shinto. Its influence was so great that at one time, all Shinto priests across the country had to be certified here.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Daigengu Where Eight Million Gods Gather

Walking the forest path of Mount Yoshida is healing in itself. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Saijosho Daigengu (斎場所大元宮)**

The highlight of Yoshida Shrine! This is a unique octagonal building constructed by Yoshida Kanetomo.
Enshrined here are **all 3,132 deities** from every shrine across Japan. This means that praying here is said to have the immense effect of praying at all shrines in Japan! It is usually closed but is opened to the public on special days like New Year's and Setsubun. (Worship from the outside is always possible).

#### **Unique Deities: The Gods of Cooking and Confections**

- **Sankage Shrine (God of Cooking)**: Fujiwara no Yamakage, the founder of Yoshida Shrine, is also known as the originator of the Japanese way of cooking. It's a place visited by chefs and restaurant owners praying for improved skills and prosperity.
- **Kaso Shrine (God of Confections)**: This shrine enshrines Tajimamori, who sought out the tachibana orange (the origin of sweets), and Lin Join, who spread the use of manju (steamed buns). It's a must-visit pilgrimage site for pastry chefs and those who love sweets.

#### **Setsubun Festival and Oni**

Every February, Yoshida Shrine comes alive with the **'Setsubun Festival,'** a ritual to drive out demons (oni). The ceremony, where fearsome demons appear and beans are thrown to ward off evil spirits, is a quintessential winter event in Kyoto.
