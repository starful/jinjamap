title: 'Encountering the Legend of the Dragon Palace in a Cave Beneath a Cliff: A
  Mystical Pilgrimage to Udo Shrine in Miyazaki'
---

Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to share the excitement of travel.

Today, I want to guide you to the Nichinan Coast in Miyazaki Prefecture, Kyushu, where the dazzling blue Pacific Ocean endlessly surges. Atop a sheer cliff, amidst a magnificent landscape sculpted by crashing white waves and rugged rock formations, lies a shrine in an unbelievable setting. This is **Udo Jingu Shrine (鵜戸神宮)**, which has built its crimson nest inside a cave.

This place is more than just a scenic tourist spot. It is a vital stage that opens the prologue of Japan's founding mythology and a sacred site where ancient legends of love between gods and mortals, and the conception of life, still breathe. The sound of the waves beyond the red railings is like a whisper from the Dragon Palace, and the water drops falling from the cave ceiling seem to sing a song of a mother's love.

For those wishing to form a connection, those awaiting the birth of a new life, and all who want to reflect on themselves before the overwhelming power of nature, Udo Shrine will provide an unforgettable experience. Now, shall we embark on a pilgrimage with me into the mystical cave where myth and reality intersect?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Heart of Myth Where Sea Meets Land

Knowing the stories enshrined in a place is the best way to deepen your travel experience. Udo Shrine honors a very important deity directly linked to the Japanese imperial lineage, and its background contains a love story as dramatic as any novel.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): A Link in Japanese History】**

The main deity of Udo Shrine has an extraordinary name: **'Hikonagisatake Ugayafukiaezu no Mikoto (日子波瀲武鸕鷀草葺不合尊)'**.
This long-named deity is the father of Japan's first emperor, 'Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇)'. In other words, this is a historic and highly prestigious shrine that enshrines a direct ancestor of the Japanese Imperial Family.

Thanks to this background, Udo Shrine has long been revered as a guardian for **easy childbirth (安産)** and **child-rearing (育児)**. Furthermore, due to the poignant love story of the parent deities, it is believed to hold miraculous powers for **matchmaking (縁結び)** and **marital harmony (夫婦和合)**. It is also a sacred place for fishermen who pray for **maritime safety (海上安全)** and **bountiful catches (大漁)**, drawing on the energy of the sea god who governs the vast ocean before them.

#### **【Origin and History: Cormorant Feathers and a Mother's Love】**

The founding myth of Udo Shrine is the story of 'Yamasachihiko (Luck of the Mountains)' and 'Toyotamahime (Princess of the Sea),' one of the most romantic and sorrowful tales in Japanese mythology.

Long ago, Yamasachihiko, having lost his brother's fishhook, ventured deep into the sea to the Dragon Palace to find it. There, he met and fell in love with the beautiful Toyotamahime, the daughter of the sea god (Watatsumi). After three dreamlike years in the Dragon Palace, Yamasachihiko returned to the surface with the lost fishhook and jewels that could control the seas.

Sometime later, a heavily pregnant Toyotamahime came ashore to find her husband. "I could not bear to give birth to a descendant of the heavenly gods in the cold sea, so I have come here."
The couple began to build a birthing hut (産屋) inside a cave. Just as they were about to finish thatching the roof with the feathers of a sea bird, the cormorant (鵜, u), labor began earlier than expected, and the baby was born before the roof was complete. The deity's name, 'Ugayafukiaezu (cormorant-feather-roof-not-completed),' originates from this urgent and mystical moment of birth.

Just before giving birth, Toyotamahime earnestly pleaded with her husband.
"I must now return to my original form to have this child. Please, I beg you, do not look inside."
However, unable to overcome his curiosity and worry, Yamasachihiko broke the taboo and peeked into the cave. There, he saw not his beautiful wife, but a giant shark (or crocodile, or dragon) writhing as it gave birth.

Deeply ashamed and saddened at having her true form seen, the princess left her newborn child behind, sealed the passage between the sea and the land, and returned to the Dragon Palace forever. But a mother's heart could not leave her baby. For her hungry child, she attached both of her breasts to a rock inside the cave. From that rock, a nourishing, milk-like substance flowed, allowing the baby to grow up healthy.

The site of this poignant legend of maternal love is the very location of the current **main hall of Udo Shrine**. This place, where the sorrow and love of myth coexist, has soothed the hearts of countless people for over a thousand years.

### 2. 🌊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Descending the Cliff to Meet the Cave

The pilgrimage route at Udo Shrine is the opposite of that at a typical shrine. While shrines are usually built 'upward' toward a mountain, Udo Shrine has a 'downward' structure (kudarimiya, 下り宮) that descends along a cliff. This unique form makes it one of the three great downward-sloping shrines in Japan, along with Nukisaki Shrine in Gunma and Kusakabe Yoshimi Shrine in Kumamoto.

#### **The Overwhelming Red Main Hall and the Harmony of the Cave**

From the parking lot, cross a red-painted bridge and follow the stone steps down through lush subtropical vegetation, and an incredible sight unfolds before your eyes. Beneath the cliffs where rough waves crash, a massive natural sea cave appears, as if its mouth is wide open.

Inside that cave rests the vibrant vermilion main hall (本殿). The contrast between the dark interior of the cave and the brilliant colors of the main hall, combined with the view of the blue sea outside, creates a sense of wonder that goes beyond mere mystery.
As you stand before the main hall with your shoes off, your ears are filled only with the magnificent sound of the waves. The cave acts as a natural resonance chamber, amplifying the sound. A prayer offered with this sound of nature as a backdrop resonates more deeply than ever before.

#### **Ochichiiwa (お乳岩): A Mother's Unending Love**

If you go around to the back of the main hall, you can see the **'Ochichiiwa (Breast Rock)'** from the myth with your own eyes.
Just as the legend tells, clear water still continuously drips from the protruding part of the rock. Since ancient times, it has been believed that drinking this water ensures a good supply of breast milk and helps children grow up healthy. Although it is now difficult to drink the water directly for hygiene reasons, the sight of worshippers praying for their children's health or a safe delivery as they gaze at the rock is still filled with earnestness.

Udo Shrine's famous specialty, **'Ochichi-ame (お乳あめ)'**, is made using this sacred water (Ochichi-mizu). This candy, with its gentle sweetness of ginger and starch syrup, is cherished as the best gift and charm for expectant or nursing mothers.

#### **Kameishi (亀石) and Undama (運玉) Tossing**

After your prayers, stand at the railing in front of the main hall and look down at the sheer cliff below. You will see a giant rock shaped like a turtle. This is the **'Kameishi (Turtle Rock)'**. According to legend, the turtle that Toyotamahime rode from the Dragon Palace turned to stone while waiting for the princess.

On the turtle's back, there is a small hollow marked with a rope. There is a fun ritual where it is said your wish will come true if you toss a small clay ball called **'Undama (fortune ball)'** into this hollow.

- **How to throw**: Men must throw with their left hand, and women with their right.
- **Price**: 200 yen for 5 balls.

The distance is greater than it looks, and the sea breeze is strong, making it quite challenging to succeed. But the thrill when an Undama lands in the hollow with a satisfying clink is indescribable. Even if you fail, don't be disappointed. It is said that an Undama that shatters against the rock takes your bad luck with it, which can lighten your heart.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Engraving the Memories

If you want to cherish the memories of your visit to Udo Shrine for a long time, be sure to get a goshuin and special souvenirs.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Udo Shrine is characterized by its powerful and dynamic calligraphy, much like the sea itself. The red shrine seal in the center and the weighty characters for '鵜戸神宮 (Udo Jingu)' will make you feel the mystical energy of the cave once more just by looking at them. The original goshuincho (stamp book) features beautifully depicted scenes of the shrine's landscape or mythological events, making it highly collectible.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Ochichi-ame**: The "breast milk candy" introduced earlier. This candy, in its simple packaging, is the most iconic souvenir symbolizing Udo Shrine.
- **Safe Childbirth Charm (安産御守)**: As one of Japan's most famous spots for easy childbirth, a variety of safe childbirth charms are available.
- **Undama Charm**: While shaped like the Undama thrown at the turtle rock, this version comes with a strap so you can carry your good luck with you.
- **Rabbit-related Goods**: The character 'U' (鵜) in Udo sounds similar to 'U' (卯), the character for rabbit, and the Day of the Rabbit is said to have a deep connection to the shrine. Because of this, you can also find cute souvenirs with rabbit motifs.

### 4. 🚗 Nearby Attractions & Cuisine: The Nichinan Coast Drive

The Nichinan Coast Road, where Udo Shrine is located, is a beautiful driving course so scenic it's called the 'Sun Road.' Here are some nearby attractions to visit along with the shrine.

#### **1. Sun Messe Nichinan (サンメッセ日南)**

A 10-minute drive from Udo Shrine. This theme park is famous for its **seven giant Moai statues** standing with the blue sea at their back. They were erected with the only permission for restoration granted by the Easter Island elders' council in the world. Each statue symbolizes a different type of luck, such as work, health, and love. The panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean from the 'Hill of the Sun' at the top of the park is breathtakingly refreshing.

#### **2. Aoshima Shrine (青島神社)**

Located about a 30-minute drive north from Udo Shrine towards Miyazaki City. The entire small island, surrounded by a bizarre wave-cut rock formation called the **'Devil's Washboard (鬼の洗濯板)'**, is a shrine. This shrine also enshrines Yamasachihiko and Toyotamahime, making it a perfect addition to a 'mythology pilgrimage' course along with Udo Shrine. The grounds, overgrown with the subtropical plant Livistona, have an exotic atmosphere, almost as if you've stepped into Southeast Asia.

#### **3. Cuisine: Seafood at Horikawa Restaurant**

Nichinan is a port town famous for its bonito (katsuo) fishing. You can find many restaurants serving fresh seafood near Udo Shrine or around Aburatsu Port.

- **Recommended Dishes**: I recommend the 'Katsuo Aburi Ju (Seared Bonito Rice Bowl)' or Miyazaki's soul food, 'Chicken Nanban.' A rice bowl with freshly caught fish is especially delicious and will make you forget the fatigue of your journey. Try visiting local favorites like 'Horikawa Restaurant.'

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Udo Shrine is more than just a place for wish-making; it is like a grand epic that holds the wonder of nature and the story of fundamental human love.

The thrill of standing before the red shrine that illuminates the darkness of the cave, while watching the waves that have relentlessly washed ashore for thousands of years. And the moments of cheering like a child while throwing the Undama. I hope all these experiences bring fresh energy and comfort to your weary heart.

For some, it will be a place to make a heartfelt wish; for others, a place remembered for its unforgettable scenery. On your next trip to Kyushu, why not become the protagonist of a myth along the blue sea of Nichinan?

**JinjaMap** will be back with more stories of hidden gem shrines from all corners of Japan. May good fortune always be with you on your travels! 🌊🐢
