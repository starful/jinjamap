Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, we journey to Nagoya, the heart of central Japan. Did you know that in the midst of this bustling city lies a vast forest that has held its silence for 1,900 years?
This is **'Atsuta Jingu (熱田神宮),'** the shrine that enshrines the legendary sword **'Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi,'** one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Japanese Imperial Family.

As one of Japan's three great shrines, it is a sacred site visited by 7 million people annually. From the earthen wall offered by Oda Nobunaga after a miraculous victory, to a mystical spring said to beautify the skin, and even Nagoya's best restaurants—
let's journey right now into the 'Forest of Atsuta,' where myth and history come alive.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Where the Legendary Sword Resides

The prestige of Atsuta Jingu can be explained by the single 'object' it enshrines.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Atsuta-no-Okami】**

The main deity here is **Atsuta-no-Okami**. This refers to the divine spirit dwelling within the **'Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (Grass-Cutting Sword).'**
This sword, obtained by the god Susanoo after defeating a monstrous serpent and offered to the sun goddess Amaterasu, symbolizes military power and authority. The other enshrined deities are also prominent figures from mythology, including Yamato Takeru (the hero who wielded the sword) and Susanoo. Because of this, the shrine is believed to hold powerful sway over **national peace**, **good fortune in battle**, and **the granting of wishes**.

#### **【Origins and History: A Hero's Love and Parting】**

The shrine's founding legend is tragic yet beautiful. The hero Yamato Takeru, on his way back from conquering the eastern provinces, fell in love with and married a woman from Owari (Nagoya) named Miyasuhime. However, he left his divine sword—his other self—in his wife's care when he departed to subdue the god of Mount Ibuki.
He ultimately fell ill and passed away. The grieving Miyasuhime built a shrine to house her husband's keepsake, the divine sword. This was the beginning of Atsuta Jingu 1,900 years ago. It feels as if the poignant emotion of a shrine built in memory of a loved one permeates the entire forest.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Wall of Victory and the Spring of Beauty

The 60,000-tsubo (approx. 198,000 sq. meters) forest in the city center is a massive healing spot in itself. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Nobunaga-bei Wall (信長塀): A Miraculous Victory**

On the path to the main hall, you can see a unique wall made of layered earth and tiles. In 1560, **Oda Nobunaga** prayed here for certain victory before the 'Battle of Okehazama,' where he was overwhelmingly outnumbered. After miraculously winning, he dedicated this 'Nobunaga-bei Wall' as a token of gratitude. Walk along the wall and soak in the victorious energy.

#### **Okusu (Giant Camphor Tree): The Sacred Tree Where a Snake Lives**

Within the grounds are giant camphor trees over 1,000 years old. The **'Okusu'** in front of the main hall is said to have been planted by Kobo Daishi, and a snake is believed to live inside it. There's a popular belief that if you're lucky enough to see this snake, your **financial luck** will skyrocket, so keep your eyes peeled!

#### **Shimizusha (Okami-no-Izumi): The Secret to Beautiful Skin**

Near the forest path behind the main hall (Kokoro-no-Komichi) is a small shrine called **'Shimizusha.'** The spring behind it, **'Okami-no-Izumi,'** has a legend that washing your skin with its water will make it beautiful. They say even Yang Guifei, one of the world's three great beauties, benefited from this water! Sprinkle water on the rock in the center of the spring three times and make a wish.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Embodying Victory and Love

The items offered at Atsuta Jingu are as meaningful as its historical background.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

Atsuta Jingu's goshuin exudes authority in its simplicity. It features the powerful calligraphy of **'熱田神宮'** and the shrine's divine crest (shinmon). You can also receive the goshuin of the detached shrine, 'Hakkengu.'

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Charm (Kachimamori)**: An amulet imbued with the victorious energy of Oda Nobunaga. It will lend you strength in crucial moments like exams, competitions, or business ventures.
- **White Bird Charm (Shiratori-mamori)**: This charm originates from the legend that Yamato Takeru became a white bird after his death. It is a charm for **finding a partner** and protecting **love**.
- **Bell of the Heart**: The clear sound of the bell helps you find inner peace.

### 4. 🍱 Nearby Attractions: The Taste of Nagoya, Hitsumabushi

After visiting the shrine, indulge in Nagoya's finest cuisine.

#### **1. Atsuta Houraiken Main Store**

- **Location**: Right next to the shrine's main gate (3-min walk).
- **Features**: This is the **birthplace and original restaurant** of Nagoya's specialty, **'Hitsumabushi (grilled eel on rice).'** The eel, grilled with a 140-year-old secret sauce, is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Don't miss the "three-way" feast: eating it as is, with condiments, and as ochazuke (with broth poured over it). (The lines are long, so make a reservation or get a numbered ticket in advance!)

#### **2. Shirotori Garden**

- **Location**: 10-min walk.
- **Features**: The largest Japanese-style garden in the Chubu region. The seasonal flowers, autumn leaves, and the 'Seiutei' tea house, which seems to float on the water, are beautiful. Here you can experience a refined natural beauty distinct from the shrine's forest.

#### **3. Nagoya Castle**

- **Travel**: 15 minutes by subway.
- **Features**: Nagoya's landmark, with its shining golden shachihoko (tiger-fish). If you felt ancient times at Atsuta Jingu, here you can experience the splendid Edo period.
