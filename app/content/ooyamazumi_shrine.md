Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find hidden gems and sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **Omishima (大三島)**, the heart of the 'Shimanami Kaido,' a route that connects the beautiful islands of the Seto Inland Sea. Known as the 'Island of the Gods,' this place is home to a great sacred site that has protected the mountains, the sea, and warriors since ancient times: **'Oyamazumi Shrine (大山祇神社)'**.

It's a place like a treasure vault, where a mystical forest of camphor trees over 2,600 years old thrives, and where 80% of Japan's National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties in the form of armor and helmets lie in slumber. A special journey into mythology by crossing the sea on a bicycle begins now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Great God Encompassing Mountains and Seas

Behind the grandeur of Oyamazumi Shrine lies a vast story that weaves through Japanese mythology and history.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Oyamatsumi-no-kami】**

The main deity here is **Oyamatsumi-no-kami**. As the name suggests, he is the 'God of Great Mountains,' but because the water flowing from the mountains reaches the sea, he is also revered as the **'God of the Sea'** and the **'God of Maritime Safety'**.
Furthermore, since legendary warrior clans like the Genji and Heike prayed to him for victory, he also has a strong character as the **'God of War (Mushin)'** and the **'God of Victory'**. Mountains, seas, and victory—he truly deserves to be called the **'Guardian Deity of all Japan (Nihon Sochinju)'**.

#### **【Origins and History: A Sacred Site for Warriors】**

The shrine's history dates back 2,600 years. It is so ancient that there is a legend that it was founded by a descendant of Baekje royalty following a divine revelation.
From the Heian to the Kamakura period, contemporary heroes like Minamoto no Yoritomo and Yoshitsune dedicated their armor and swords here, praying for fortune in battle. Thanks to them, this place has become not just a shrine but a **'living museum of warriors'**.

### 2. 🌲 Strolling the Precincts: A Millennial Camphor Tree and a Wish-Granting Gate

The precincts are filled with a sacred energy emanating from a vast forest of camphor trees.

#### **2,600-Year-Old Sacred Tree (Ochi-no-Miko's Camphor Tree)**

Upon entering the precincts, an overwhelmingly large camphor tree captures your attention. With a circumference of 11 meters, this tree is said to have been planted by the shrine's founder and is an astonishing **2,600 years old**. Standing before the tree and taking a deep breath feels like receiving primeval energy throughout your body. (Designated as a Natural Monument)

#### **Sacred Tree of Life's Water (Ikiki-no-Gomon)**

On the forest path behind the main hall, there is the **'Sacred Tree of Life's Water,'** where two camphor trees with connected roots have naturally formed a gate. Legend has it that passing through this tree tunnel grants **long life and health** and makes wishes come true. Feel reborn as you pass through the narrow gap between the trees.

#### **Main Hall and Worship Hall**

Rebuilt in 1427, the main hall is a wooden structure in the unique **'Mishima-zukuri'** style. Its unadorned, simple yet solid appearance exudes a dignity befitting a shrine dedicated to the god of war.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Tokens of Victory

Befitting a sacred site for warriors, there are many talismans filled with powerful energy.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Oyamazumi Shrine is overflowing with power. The profound characters for **'日本総鎮守 (Guardian Deity of all Japan)'** and **'大山祇神社 (Oyamazumi Shrine)'** with the red seal are like a powerful amulet in themselves.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Amulet (Kachimamori)**: A must-have for those who want to win at crucial moments in life. The gold lettering on a black background is striking.
- **Maritime Safety Amulet**: Popular among fishermen and those who enjoy marine sports.
- **Helmet Amulet**: This unique amulet, modeled after the helmets of the naval forces that protected this area, ensures traffic safety.
