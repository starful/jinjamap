Hello, readers! This is your 'JinjaMap' editor, here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to **'Hokkaido Jingu (北海道神宮)'**, an essential stop on any trip to Sapporo, the heart of the snowy land of Hokkaido. Just a 15-minute subway ride from central Sapporo, this shrine is surrounded by a dense primeval forest that makes you forget you're in a city.

Established during the Meiji era to pioneer the then-unknown land of Hokkaido, this place still holds the fervent aspirations and hopes of the people from 150 years ago.
Why not take a moment to pause your journey here, enjoying a warm grilled rice cake amidst beautiful scenery—cherry blossoms in spring, autumn leaves, and pure white snowscapes in winter?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Sanctuary for the Gods Who Pioneered Hokkaido

Hokkaido Jingu was born along with the beginning of this land.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Three Pioneer Gods and Emperor Meiji】**

This shrine is dedicated to the **'Three Pioneer Deities'**: **Okunitama-no-kami (god of the land)**, **Ōkuninushi-no-kami (god of nation-building)**, and **Sukunahikona-no-kami (god of medicine and wisdom)**. They are the gods who were enshrined to develop the harsh land of Hokkaido and protect its people.
Later, **Emperor Meiji**, who decreed the development of Hokkaido, was also enshrined here, making them powerful guardian deities who watch over all aspects of life, including **national peace**, **business prosperity**, **health and longevity**, and **traffic safety**.

#### **【Origins and History: From Ezochi to Hokkaido】**

In 1869, Emperor Meiji renamed 'Ezochi' to 'Hokkaido' and initiated its development. To soothe the hearts of the settlers who had to battle the harsh nature, a shrine was established at its current location in 1871.
At that time, it was called 'Sapporo Jinja' (Sapporo Shrine), but in recognition of its status, it was promoted to **'Jingu' (Grand Shrine)** in 1964. For the people of Hokkaido, it is like a spiritual home.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Healing and Squirrels in the Primeval Forest

The shrine grounds, connected to Maruyama Park, are nature itself. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Second Torii Gate and the Main Approach**

The **Second Torii**, which serves as the main gate of the shrine, boasts a magnificent presence. As you walk along the straight path past it, the fresh air from the towering trees on both sides will clear your head. If you're lucky, you might even spot a cute **Ezo Risu (Hokkaido squirrel)** scurrying between the trees!

#### **Kaitaku Jinja (開拓神社 - Pioneer Shrine)**

This is a small shrine located next to the main hall. It enshrines 37 individuals who made significant contributions to the development of Hokkaido, such as Mamiya Rinzō and Inō Tadataka. It's a good place to reflect and show gratitude for the hard work of the ancestors who cultivated this barren land.

#### **Rokkatei Jingu Chaya (Hangan-sama)**

The highlight of your visit! The famous Hokkaido confectionery **'Rokkatei'** operates a tea house within the shrine grounds. Its specialty, **'Hangan-sama'**, is a grilled buckwheat mochi (rice cake) filled with red bean paste. It can only be tasted here, and it's absolutely delicious when enjoyed with the complimentary hot tea. (The price is very reasonable too!)

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**
