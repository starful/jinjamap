### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: The Sun Goddess Protecting Kobe

Before you pass through the red torii gate of Ikuta Shrine, let's first explore the mystical legends enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Wakahirume-no-Mikoto】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Wakahirume-no-Mikoto**. Her name means 'young and vibrant sun goddess,' and she is the younger sister of the sun goddess Amaterasu and a master of weaving.
As a deity who creates fabric by weaving threads, she demonstrates exceptional ability in forging **'connections (enmusubi)'** between people. Visitors pray not only for romantic relationships but also for good fortune in all human connections, including friendships and professional opportunities.

#### **【Origins and History: Rising Again Like a Phoenix】**

The shrine's history dates back to 201 AD. When Empress Jingu's fleet was unable to proceed off the coast of Kobe, she received a divine message and built a shrine at this location.
Ikuta Shrine has faced numerous trials. It was a fierce battlefield during the Genpei War in the 12th century, suffered through air raids in World War II, and endured the Great Hanshin Earthquake in 1995. However, each time, it was magnificently rebuilt through the efforts of its citizens. For this reason, it is known as a powerful spot for **'rebirth'** and **'regeneration.'** It is a place that offers great courage to those who wish to overcome failure and start anew.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Mystical Forest and Water Fortune in the City

Just a 10-minute walk from the bustling Sannomiya Station. Pass through the red torii gate, and a completely different world unfolds.

#### **Main Hall and Ikuta Forest**

Behind the magnificent vermilion main hall lies the **'Ikuta Forest.'** This dense forest, unbelievable for its location in the heart of the city, is as beautiful as it was when praised by poets a thousand years ago. A walk through the forest, breathing in the fresh air, will clear your cluttered mind.

#### **Ikuta Pond & Mizumikuji (Water Fortune)**

The clear pond within the forest is a highlight of Ikuta Shrine. Be sure to try the famous **'Mizumikuji (water fortune).'** When you float the blank paper slip on the pond's surface, characters magically appear to reveal your fortune. Don't miss this romantic and mystical experience!

#### **The Powerful Life Force of the Sacred Cedar Tree**

Next to the main hall stands a giant cedar tree. This tree, which survived the fires of war, is a symbol of powerful life force. Place your hand on the tree and pray for health and recovery.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Tying the Thread of Fate

The amulets and souvenirs at Ikuta Shrine feature lovely designs centered on the theme of 'connection.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here changes with the seasons. The gorgeous **'Kirigami (paper cutout)' goshuin**, which captures the essence of each season—cherry blossoms in spring, fireworks in summer, autumn foliage—is considered a treasure among collectors. Experience the charm of a limited-edition stamp that you can only receive at the time of your visit.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Tamaki (Bracelet Amulet)**: A bracelet-style charm woven with red and blue threads. Meaning 'to connect (ki) the soul (tama),' it is said to securely tie your relationships. It also works perfectly as a fashion accessory.
- **Heart Ema**: Write your wish for love on a pink, heart-shaped ema (votive tablet) and hang it up. The countless hearts create a stunning pink spectacle.
- **Happiness Amulet (Shiawase Mamori)**: This charm, embroidered with a four-leaf clover, is believed to bring small joys and happiness.
