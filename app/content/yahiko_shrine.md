Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to discovering Japan's hidden sacred gems.

Today, I will guide you to the foot of Mount Yahiko, a sacred mountain (霊山) overlooking the vast Echigo Plain in Niigata Prefecture, in the northern part of Honshu, Japan. Here lies the grand **Yahiko Shrine (彌彦神社)**, which has watched over this land for over 2,400 years.

Affectionately known as **'Oyahiko-sama (おやひこさま)'** by the locals, this beloved place is more than just an ancient shrine. It is the legendary stage where gods from Japan's creation myths descended to cultivate the rugged land and spread civilization, and it is a supreme power spot that imbues those starting new ventures with a powerful 'aura of success.'

From the mysterious stone that gauges the weight of your wishes to the path through a forest of cedar trees soaring towards the sky, and the maple valley that paints the world crimson in autumn—shall we embark on a mystical pilgrimage with me to Yahiko Shrine, where the soul of Echigo lives and breathes?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Great God Who Pioneered Echigo

Before passing through the shrine's magnificent torii gate, understanding the deity who resides here and the stories surrounding them is the most important key to deepening your journey. At the heart of Yahiko Shrine rests a very special 'pioneer.'

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ameno-Kaguyama-no-Mikoto】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Ameno-Kaguyama-no-Mikoto (天香山命)**.
As the great-grandson of the sun goddess Amaterasu, he is a hero in mythology who descended from the heavens under the order of the first emperor to develop the rugged land of Echigo. He taught the people how to make salt and fish from the sea, and how to plant rice seeds and farm the land. In essence, he is the 'founder of industry' and the 'god of culture' who spread civilization and prosperity.

Due to this background, he is revered today as the deity who governs all fortunes related to work and success, including **business prosperity (商売繁盛)**, **bountiful harvests**, and **technological advancement**. Countless people planning new businesses, seeking promotions at work, or praying for project success flock here from all over the country to receive his powerful 'pioneering energy.'

#### **【Origins and History: A 2,400-Year Legacy】**

The history of Yahiko Shrine dates back to the age of myths, predating written records. According to legend, Ameno-Kaguyama-no-Mikoto landed on the Nozu coast here by boat over 2,400 years ago, dedicated his life to developing the region, and was eventually buried on Mount Yahiko. His descendants built a sanctuary at the foot of the mountain to honor him, which marked the beginning of Yahiko Shrine. This means that Mount Yahiko itself is considered the grand divine body (御神体) where the god resides.

Historically, this shrine was revered as the **'Ichinomiya (一宮)'**, the highest-ranking shrine in Echigo Province (the former name of Niigata). Great heroes of their time, such as Uesugi Kenshin and Minamoto no Yoritomo, worshipped here, praying for martial fortune and the well-being of their domains. During the Edo period, it prospered under the generous protection of the shogunate. Although it suffered a devastating fire in 1912, it was rebuilt to its current magnificent and beautiful state in 1916, thanks to enormous donations and the devotion of worshippers from across the country.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Mystical Stone and Cedar Forest

A visit to Yahiko Shrine begins with a walk along a path through a dense forest. As you breathe in the pure air released by centuries-old cedar trees, you will feel your mind's distractions fade away and your spirit being purified.

#### **The Majestic Haiden and the Architectural Beauty of 'Yahiko-zukuri'**

The Hall of Worship (拝殿, Haiden) that appears at the end of the forest path is truly overwhelming. Rebuilt in 1916, this building was constructed in a unique style rarely seen at other shrines, known as **'Yahiko-zukuri (弥彦造)'**. Its elegant, layered roof curves and grand appearance boast such outstanding architectural beauty that it has been designated as a National Registered Tangible Cultural Property. Offer your prayers here with sincere devotion, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette. You might feel a thrill as the sound of your claps echoes through the forest, as if reaching the gods.

#### **A Must-Try Experience: The Wish-Granting 'Hinotamaishi'**

One power spot at Yahiko Shrine you absolutely cannot miss is the **'Hinotamaishi (Fire Ball Stone)'**. Also known as 'Omokaru-no-ishi (Heavy-Light Stones),' there is always a line of people in front of these two stones.

- **How to try it**: First, make a wish silently in your heart. Then, try to lift one of the stones.
- **The result**: If the stone feels **'lighter'** than you expected, it's a sign your wish will come true! Conversely, if it feels **'heavier'**, it means more effort is needed.

It may seem like simple fun, but the difference in perceived weight when you lift the stone is truly mysterious. Will your wish be light or heavy? Try it for yourself and find out!

#### **'Tama-no-hashi': The Bridge for the Gods**

The red arched bridge in the middle of the main path, **'Tama-no-hashi (Bridge of the Jewel)'**, is a sacred bridge that only the gods may cross. Humans are not permitted to walk on it, but simply admiring its elegant form blending with the forest brings a sense of calm to the heart.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing the Energy of Success

After finishing your prayers, it's time to preserve the experience in a physical form. The souvenirs and amulets from Yahiko Shrine are especially meaningful as they embody success and pioneering.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Yahiko Shrine is the epitome of elegance. A red seal with the **chrysanthemum crest**, symbolizing the Imperial Family, is stamped over the powerful calligraphy of **'彌彦神社' (Yahiko Jinja)**. This is a testament to the shrine's deep connection with the Imperial household. Simply having this profound record in your goshuincho (goshuin book) feels like gaining a steadfast guardian deity.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono】**

- **Shobai-hanjo (Business Prosperity) Omamori**: This is the most popular amulet for entrepreneurs and business owners. It is recommended for those who wish to receive the pioneering god's energy to make their business flourish.
- **Shika-no-fuda (Deer Antler Talisman)**: This is modeled after the antlers of a deer, the divine messenger of Yahiko Shrine. It is a powerful talisman for **sho-un (勝運)**, or victory luck in competitions. It makes a great gift for students taking exams or job seekers.
- **Yumiya (Bow and Arrow)**: A decorative item that symbolizes warding off evil spirits and shooting down good fortune.

### 4. 🍁 Nearby Attractions: A Feast of Autumn Colors and Cuisine

After visiting the shrine, enhance your trip by enjoying the beautiful nature and delicious food Yahiko has to offer.

#### **1. Yahiko Park 'Momijidani (Maple Valley)'**

- **Why we recommend it**: Located right next to the shrine, this is Niigata's premier spot for autumn foliage. In the fall, the maple leaves create a fantastic tunnel of color around the red Kangetsu-kyo Bridge (観月橋). The evening illuminations make it even more romantic.

#### **2. Mount Yahiko Ropeway & Summit Park**

- **Why we recommend it**: A 5-minute ropeway ride from behind the shrine takes you to the summit of Mount Yahiko. There, you will find the **'Go-shinbyo (Sacred Mausoleum)'**, where the main deity and his consort are enshrined. The panoramic view of the Echigo Plain and the Sea of Japan from here is breathtaking and incredibly refreshing.

#### **3. Specialty Snack 'Pandayaki' (Bunsui-do Main Store)**

- **Why we recommend it**: This famous Yahiko specialty once ranked "No. 1 in the national snack ranking." Pandayaki, a chewy white bun filled with a paste made from Niigata's specialty **edamame (green soybeans)**, is a treat you must try. You'll fall in love first with its cute shape, and second with its savory flavor.
