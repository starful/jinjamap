Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover hidden gems and sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **'Miyajidake Shrine (宮地嶽神社)'**, a place renowned among Fukuoka travelers as a spot for that 'perfect shot of a lifetime.' Made even more famous as the backdrop for an airline commercial starring the popular idol group Arashi (嵐), this shrine offers a breathtakingly moving experience with its **'Path of Light (Hikari no Michi)'**—a straight road from the shrine steps to the sea, perfectly aligned with the setting sun.

But its true charm doesn't end there. It is a grand shrine, home to a massive sacred rope, a giant drum, and a giant bell, all acclaimed as the **best in Japan (日本一)**. It is also a powerful 'power spot' where the heroic Empress Jingu prayed for victory some 1,700 years ago.

Shall we journey together to Miyajidake Shrine, a mystical place where golden sunsets and ancient history converge?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Legend of the Victorious Heroine

The origins of Miyajidake Shrine are linked to the great challenge of one woman.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Empress Jingu and the Gods of Victory】**

The main deity (主祭神) enshrined here is **Okinagatarashihime-no-mikoto (Empress Jingu)**.
She is the legendary heroine who, after losing her husband and while pregnant, crossed the sea to conquer the Three Kingdoms of Korea. As a symbol of overcoming adversity to achieve victory, this shrine is believed to bring exceptional blessings for **'kaiun (opening up good fortune)'**, **'business prosperity'**, and **'luck in competitions'**.
The co-enshrined deities, **Katsumura** and **Katsuyori**, are also gods of victory, with their names containing the character for 'victory' (勝).

#### **【Origin and History: The Treasure Buried at the Mountaintop】**

About 1,700 years ago, before embarking on her expedition, Empress Jingu climbed to the summit of Mt. Miyaji, built an altar, and prayed for victory. It is said that before setting sail, she buried her cherished treasures at the summit, which marks the beginning of the shrine.
In fact, a massive ancient tomb was discovered behind the shrine, and from it, a trove of national treasure-grade golden artifacts was unearthed, proving that the legend was more than just a story. This is a historic site where a powerful maritime force existed since ancient times.

### 2. ☀️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Path of Light and Three "Best in Japan"

The grounds of Miyajidake Shrine are 'grand,' 'beautiful,' and 'mystical.'

#### **The Path of Light (Hikari no Michi)**

From the top of the shrine's stone steps, turn around and look. The approach path stretches in a straight line, connecting to the sea.
Especially in **February and October**, only twice a year! You can witness a miraculous scene where the setting sun aligns perfectly with the center of this path, creating a golden road from the sea to the shrine. During these periods, a 'Sunset Festival' is held, and it's so popular that you need a numbered ticket to view it. (Don't be disappointed, as the sunset is beautiful on other days too!)

#### **Japan's Largest O-Shimenawa (Giant Sacred Rope)**

In front of the main worship hall (haiden) hangs a giant sacred rope that will leave you speechless. Length 11m, diameter 2.6m, weight 3 tons! This sacred rope, woven from straw by 1,500 volunteers each year, boasts the title of **the largest in Japan**. Standing beneath it, you feel a sense of security, as if no misfortune could ever approach you.

#### **Okunomiya Hachisha Meguri (Pilgrimage to the 8 Inner Shrines)**

Behind the main hall, there are eight small shrines known as the **'Okunomiya (Inner Sanctuary)'**.

- **No. 1 Nanfuku Shrine**: For the Seven Lucky Gods who bring good fortune.
- **No. 2 Inari Shrine**: The god of business prosperity, with beautiful red torii gates.
- **No. 3 Fudo Shrine**: This shrine enshrines Fudo Myoo inside a **huge ancient tomb (kofun)**. Don't miss the special experience of being able to worship inside an actual ancient tomb.
  It is said that if you visit all eight shrines, one great wish will be granted, so be sure to give it a try! (Takes about 30-40 minutes)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Items: Capturing Golden Fortune

As a sacred place of victory and good fortune, there are many shrine items imbued with powerful energy.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Miyajidake Shrine is exquisite for its powerful calligraphy. Especially during the 'Path of Light' season (February, October), you can receive a limited-edition goshuin featuring a **golden sun**. The shimmering gold ink looks as if it will bring good luck.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Charm (Kachimamori)**: An amulet for certain victory, containing the spirit of Empress Jingu. Engraved with the character for 'victory' (勝), it is perfect for those facing exams or competitions.
- **Path of Light Charm**: An amulet embodying the wish for a bright future to open up ahead. Recommended for those making a new start.
