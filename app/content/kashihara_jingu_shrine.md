Among Japan's countless shrines, is there any place where the word 'beginning' fits so perfectly? Located in the heart of Nara Prefecture, Kashihara Jingu Shrine is more than just a religious facility; it is a majestic space symbolizing the mythological origins of the nation of Japan. This grand shrine was built on the very site where Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇), said to be the first emperor of Japan, ascended to the throne, offering visitors a sense of primordial energy and the weight of history. Here, where massive structures built on vast grounds blend with a deep forest, we embark on a mystical journey through time where myth and history intersect.

### 1. 🙏 Enshrined Deities and Origins: The Moment Myth Becomes History

The main deities, or *saijin* (祭神), enshrined at Kashihara Jingu are **Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇), the first emperor of Japan**, and his empress, **Himetataraisuzuhime-no-mikoto (媛蹈鞴五十鈴媛命)**.

To understand the origins of this shrine, one must go back to the distant age of myths recorded in Japan's oldest historical texts, the *Kojiki* (古事記) and the *Nihon Shoki* (日本書紀). Emperor Jimmu, a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami (天照大御神), embarked on a long journey eastward from the Hyūga region (modern-day Miyazaki Prefecture) in search of a better land to rule the country in peace. This expedition is known as "Jimmu's Eastern Expedition" (神武東征).

His journey was far from smooth. He faced numerous hardships, encountering rough seas, rugged mountains, and resistance from powerful local clans. In a moment of dire crisis, a divine messenger sent by Amaterasu Ōmikami, the three-legged crow **Yatagarasu (八咫烏)**, appeared to guide his way. With the sacred guidance of Yatagarasu, Emperor Jimmu crossed the treacherous mountains of Kumano and finally arrived in Yamato, present-day Nara.

Surveying the land, he declared, "This place is surrounded by green mountains on all four sides; there is no better place to govern the realm," and established his capital here, in Kashihara (橿原). It is said that on the first day of the first month in 660 BCE, he ascended to the throne as the first emperor of Japan at the Kashihara Palace. This is the founding myth of Japan and the historical backdrop for the land where Kashihara Jingu now stands.

Interestingly, the shrine was built on this mythological site relatively recently, in 1890 (the 23rd year of the Meiji era). Following the Meiji Restoration, in accordance with Emperor Meiji's wish to establish an emperor-centered state and inspire national pride, the grand shrine was founded on this sacred ground of the nation's origin through nationwide donations and efforts. In other words, Kashihara Jingu is a monumental space that revives ancient mythology in the modern era, imbued with the nation's aspirations.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The precincts (*keidai*, 境内) of Kashihara Jingu boast a vast area of about 500,000 square meters. Befitting its scale, the atmosphere is grand and serene, instilling a sense of reverence from the moment you step inside.

#### **First Torii and Sandō (参道)**

Upon exiting Kintetsu Kashiharajingu-mae Station, the first thing that greets visitors is a giant wooden *torii* (鳥居) gate. This first *torii*, standing about 10 meters tall, is made of *hinoki* (Japanese cypress) and has a majestic presence. Passing through the *torii*, the long approach to the shrine, the *sandō* (参道), unfolds before you. The long *sandō* is flanked by a dense forest, and the path is covered with pure white gravel known as *tamazari* (玉砂利). As you walk, listening to the crunching sound of the gravel underfoot, the hustle and bustle of the secular world fades away, and you feel yourself entering a sacred space.

#### **Minami Shinmon (South Divine Gate) and Gehaiden (Outer Worship Hall)**

Walking along the *sandō*, you will come face to face with the magnificent Minami Shinmon (South Divine Gate). Passing through this gate reveals an incredibly vast open space and the massive Gehaiden (Outer Worship Hall). The Gehaiden, a symbol of Kashihara Jingu, was relocated from the Shinkaden (神嘉殿) of the Kyoto Imperial Palace (京都御所), making it a structure of high historical value in its own right. The sight of the Gehaiden, in perfect symmetrical harmony with the wide gravel courtyard, presents a majestic beauty that can be overwhelming. Standing here and gazing at the immense structure, one is filled with a sense of awe, feeling the smallness of humanity in contrast to the greatness of nature and the divine. It is said that by praying here while reflecting on the fact that this is the very starting point of Japan's founding, you can receive powerful energy for new beginnings.

#### **Honden (Main Sanctuary) and Naihaiden (Inner Worship Hall)**

Beyond the Gehaiden lie the Honden (Main Sanctuary) and the Naihaiden (Inner Worship Hall), the most sacred spaces where the deities are enshrined. Unfortunately, general visitors can only go as far as the Gehaiden and cannot see them directly, but the sacred aura is sufficiently conveyed just by praying with clasped hands from the outer hall. The Honden was also relocated from the Naishidokoro (内侍所) of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, demonstrating the entire shrine's deep connection to the Imperial Family.

#### **A Hidden Gem, Fukadaike Pond (深田池)**

After exploring the magnificent central area, a stroll around Fukadaike Pond, located in the northwest of the precincts, is highly recommended. This large pond, spanning about 49,500 square meters, offers a tranquil and peaceful scenery, a contrast to the grand atmosphere of the shrine. A well-maintained walking path circles the pond, making it a perfect spot for contemplation while enjoying the changing beauty of nature each season. The scenery is particularly picturesque in spring with cherry blossoms or in autumn with colorful foliage. If you felt momentarily overwhelmed by the powerful aura of the grand shrine, take a moment here to feel the breath of nature and calm your mind.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Juyohin

*Goshuin* (御朱印), which serve as proof of worship and precious souvenirs, and *juyohin* (授与品), such as amulets, are another pleasure of visiting a shrine.

#### ***Goshuin* (御朱印)**

The *goshuin* of Kashihara Jingu is very simple yet powerful. In the center, the six characters for '橿原神宮' (Kashihara Jingu) are written in a bold, strong script. In the upper right corner, instead of the Imperial Seal of Japan (the chrysanthemum), the shrine's unique crest, the *kashiwa* (橿, oak leaf), is stamped. The unadorned design exudes the dignity and prestige of a shrine dedicated to the nation's founding.

#### ***Juyohin* (Shrine Items)**

The most noteworthy *juyohin* at Kashihara Jingu are undoubtedly those featuring the **Yatagarasu (八咫烏)** motif. Yatagarasu, the divine messenger who led Emperor Jimmu to victory, is regarded as a god who 'opens the way' and 'leads to the achievement of goals.'

- **Yatagarasu Amulet:** This amulet is said to provide great strength to those starting a new business, facing an important exam, or seeking direction at a crossroads in life. It is perfect for treasuring with the prayer to open the path to victory and success.
- **Yatagarasu Ema (絵馬):** The Yatagarasu is also depicted on *ema*, the wooden plaques on which wishes are written and hung. Write down your goals and resolutions and offer them up, praying for Yatagarasu's guidance.

In addition, there are various other amulets for wishes such as health, traffic safety, and academic success, so choosing one that suits your needs can be a nice experience.

### 4. 🚶 Nearby Attractions

The central part of Nara Prefecture, where Kashihara Jingu is located, was the heart of ancient Japan, so there are plenty of historical sites to visit nearby.

#### **1. Mausoleum of Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇陵)**

This is the mausoleum of Emperor Jimmu, located a 10-minute walk northeast of Kashihara Jingu. As it is managed by the Imperial Household Agency, it has a very solemn and tranquil atmosphere. Following the worship path surrounded by a dense forest, you will reach the massive, round kofun-style tomb. Here, you can feel the breath of history in a quiet and sacred atmosphere, different from the splendor of the shrine. Visiting both the shrine and the mausoleum will deepen your understanding of the story of Emperor Jimmu.

#### **2. Asuka Village (飛鳥村)**

Easily accessible from Kashihara Jingu by train or bicycle, Asuka was the site of Japan's first full-fledged capital and is called the 'spiritual home of Japan.' It is full of attractions, including mystical ancient sites like the Takamatsuzuka Tomb and the Ishibutai Kofun, as well as Asuka-dera (飛鳥寺), Japan's oldest temple. Exploring the ancient ruins by bicycle amidst the charming rural scenery ('Asuka Rent-a-Cycle') is one of the best ways to experience the area. If you felt the 'beginning' of Japan at Kashihara Jingu, see how that history blossomed in Asuka.
