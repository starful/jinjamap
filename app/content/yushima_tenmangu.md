### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: The Perfect Harmony of Wisdom and Strength

Yushima Tenmangu Shrine is famous for the powerful synergy of its two deities.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Tenjin and the God of Strength】**

- **Sugawara no Michizane (Tenjin)**: A genius scholar and politician of the Heian period. After his unjust death, he was deified and now oversees **academic achievement**, **passing exams**, and **wisdom**. He is a spiritual pillar for students across the country.
- **Ameno-tajikarao-no-mikoto**: In mythology, when the sun goddess hid in a cave, he was the god who used his immense strength to open the stone door and bring back the light. He is known for bringing excellent fortune in **competitions**, **victory in sports**, and **warding off evil**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Old Man in a Dream and Plum Blossoms】**

The shrine was founded in 458 by order of Emperor Yuryaku to enshrine the god of strength. Later, in 1355, a villager had a dream in which Lord Michizane appeared and gave a revelation, leading to his enshrinement alongside the original deity.
During the Edo period, it flourished under the patronage of the Tokugawa shogunate as a **'center of Edo culture,'** attracting scholars and literary figures. The main hall, reconstructed in 1995, boasts magnificent beauty, built using 250-year-old high-grade Kiso hinoki cypress.

### 2. 🌸 Strolling the Grounds: The Scent of Plum Blossoms and the Legend of the Ox

As you step into the shrine grounds, the city's noise fades away, replaced by a serene atmosphere. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Nade-ushi (The Stroking Ox)**

The ox statues found throughout the grounds are a symbol of Tenjin worship. This is because Lord Michizane was born in the year of the ox, and there are many legends related to oxen.
Thanks to the belief that **'stroking the same part of the ox as your own ailment will heal it, and stroking its head will grant wisdom,'** the ox's head and horns are always polished smooth. Stroke it carefully as you pray for success in your exams.

#### **Plum Garden (Ume-en)**

Lord Michizane loved plum blossoms so much that he once wrote a poem, "When the east wind blows, send me your fragrance." The shrine grounds have about 300 plum trees, and the **'Plum Blossom Festival (Ume Matsuri)'** is held from February to March. The sight of white and red plum blossoms together is a herald of spring in Tokyo.

#### **Men's Slope (Otokozaka) vs. Women's Slope (Onnazaka)**

There are two sets of stone stairs leading up to the shrine. The steep 38 steps are the **'Otokozaka,'** symbolizing career advancement and success, while the gentle 33 steps are the **'Onnazaka,'** symbolizing relationships and peace. Which path will you choose?

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Passing Pencils (Square/Pentagonal Pencils)**: The square pencils that don't roll away and the pentagonal (gokaku) pencils, which share the same pronunciation as 'pass' (gōkaku), are essential items for the exam hall. They are engraved with Tenjin's crest, providing a sense of reassurance.
- **Academic Achievement Charms**: There are many charms with cute designs, such as the shape of a randoseru (elementary school backpack) or a book. They are also very popular as gifts!
