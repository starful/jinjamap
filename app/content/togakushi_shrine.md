Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, we guide you deep into the mountains of Nagano Prefecture, the 'roof of Japan.' This is the legendary land of **'Togakushi (戸隠)'**, where a giant rock door, hurled from the heavens by the gods 2,000 years ago, is said to have formed the mountains.

Here, you'll find a magnificent 2-kilometer-long path lined with giant cedar trees and five shrines that grant wishes. This is the **'Togakushi Shrine (戸隠神社)'**. If you wish to fling open the closed doors of your life, or if you seek to find your true self amidst overwhelming nature, then this is the place for you. The gods of incredible strength and wisdom from the myths await.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Rock Door That Fell from the Heavens

Togakushi Shrine is not a single building, but a collective name for **five shrines (Okusha, Chusha, Hokosha, Kuzuryusha, and Hiko-sha)** spread across the entire mountain. They are all connected by one grand myth.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Avengers of Mythology】**

- **Okusha (奥社)**: Enshrines **Ame-no-Tajikarao**, the god of incredible strength. With the power that lifted and threw the rock door, he helps break through obstacles in your fortune, aiding in **wish fulfillment** and **opening up good luck (開運)**.
- **Chusha (中社)**: Enshrines **Omoikane**, the god of wisdom. As the strategist who devised the plan to lure the sun goddess out, he governs **academic achievement**, **business prosperity**, and **family safety**.
- **Kuzuryusha (九頭龍社)**: Enshrines the nine-headed dragon god. As a deity who brings rain and controls water, he is believed to be effective for **matchmaking (enmusubi)** and **dental health**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of Amano-Iwato】**

According to the myth, the sun goddess Amaterasu, angered by her brother's antics, hid herself in the 'Amano-Iwato' (the heavenly rock cave), plunging the world into darkness.
The gods gathered their wisdom, piquing Amaterasu's curiosity with dance and song. As she peeked out by slightly opening the door, the powerful god Tajikarao seized it, tore it off, and threw it down to the lower world. The place where that door landed is said to have become **'Mount Togakushi (The Hidden Door Mountain)'**. Thanks to this legend, Togakushi has come to powerfully symbolize a **'place where a new world opens.'**

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Cedar Forest and the Five-Shrine Pilgrimage

The highlight of a visit to Togakushi Shrine is the 'Five-Shrine Pilgrimage,' which involves visiting all five shrines. The centerpiece of this journey is the path to the Okusha.

#### **The Path to Okusha: The Majesty of 400-Year-Old Cedars**

After passing the Zuishinmon Gate, a magnificent spectacle unfolds: a path lined with **over 200 giant cedar trees, each over 400 years old**, stretching for about 2 kilometers. Walking along this path, canopied by the sky-high trees, one feels infinitesimally small, overwhelmed by the awe of nature. This path is considered one of Japan's most powerful spiritual spots.

#### **Chusha (Middle Shrine): The Center of the Pilgrimage**

Located in the center of the village, the Chusha serves as the hub for the pilgrimage. In front of the majestic prayer hall stand the **'Three Cedars (Sanbonsugi)'**, which are 800 years old. Their immense life force naturally inspires reverence. Don't miss the dragon painting on the ceiling of the prayer hall (a work by an artist of the Kano school).

#### **Kuzuryusha: The Dragon God's Protection**

Kuzuryusha, located right next to the Okusha, enshrines the dragon god, the indigenous deity of this land. As a god who governs rain, he was revered by farmers. Uniquely, it is also believed that he can cure 'cavities,' and people sometimes offer pears to him.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Collecting the Energy of the Five Shrines

Collecting the goshuin from all five shrines is one of the greatest pleasures of the Togakushi pilgrimage.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive a goshuin with unique calligraphy at each shrine. If you collect all five, you may receive a 'completion commemoration bookmark.' (During winter, the Okusha and Kuzuryusha are closed, so their goshuin can be received at the Chusha instead.)

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Good Fortune (開運) Amulet**: The representative amulet of the Okusha. It symbolizes the power to open closed doors, helping to create new paths in life.
- **Dragon's Tooth Amulet**: The dental health amulet from Kuzuryusha. Strong teeth are a symbol of good health.
- **Wisdom Pouch**: The wisdom amulet from the Chusha. It makes a great gift for students preparing for exams.

### 4. 🥢 What to See Nearby: A Village of Soba and Ninjas

Togakushi is famous not only for its shrines but also for its cuisine and hands-on experiences.

#### **1. Togakushi Soba (Uzuraya)**

- **Location**: Right in front of the Chusha.
- **Features**: This is the home of **'Togakushi Soba,'** one of Japan's three great soba noodle varieties. The chewy noodles, served in a unique style called 'bocchi-mori,' are exceptional. In particular, **'Uzuraya'** is a legendary restaurant where people line up even before it opens, so be sure to give it a try.

#### **2. Kagami-ike (Mirror Pond)**

- **Location**: 10 minutes by car.
- **Features**: On a clear day, you can see a spectacular view of the rugged peaks of Mount Togakushi reflected on the water's surface like a mirror. During the autumn foliage season, it offers breathtaking beauty.

#### **3. Togakushi Ninja Village (Chibikko Ninja Mura)**

- **Features**: Togakushi is the birthplace of the legendary 'Togakure-ryu' school of ninjutsu. It's filled with activities that can be enjoyed with children, such as ninja house experiences and shuriken (throwing star) practice.
