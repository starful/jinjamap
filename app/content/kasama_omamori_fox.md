## 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

### 【The Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】

The central deity enshrined at Kasama Inari Shrine is **Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto (宇迦之御魂神)**. Known in Japanese mythology as the god of grains and food, the 'Uka' (宇迦) in the name signifies grains and sustenance. In Japan, where agriculture has historically been the nation's foundation, this deity has been deeply revered as the symbol of abundance—the most fundamental force that sustains life.

Over time, the deity's divine virtues expanded beyond agriculture to encompass the prosperity of all industries, including commerce and manufacturing, as well as **business success, household safety, traffic safety, and bountiful fishing**. Today, the numerous worshippers who visit Kasama Inari Shrine bow before this god, each praying for fruitful results in their own lives. Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto is a familiar yet powerful being who listens to our most universal and heartfelt wishes for a prosperous life.

### 【Origin and History】

The history of Kasama Inari Shrine dates back to 651 (the 2nd year of Hakuchi, 白雉二年), near the end of the Asuka period. Its founding story begins with a mystical revelation.

One night, an old man with shining white hair appeared in the dream of Nunoironomiya (布衣の宮), a local chieftain of the time. The old man identified himself as Ukanomitama-no-Mikoto and delivered a divine oracle:

> "If you enshrine me at the foot of Mount Mikasa (御笠山), where the **walnut tree** stands, the people will flourish, and this land will prosper for eternity."

Awakening from the dream, Nunoironomiya immediately rushed to the location indicated in the oracle. Sure enough, a massive walnut tree stood there, and from beneath it, two white foxes appeared amid a mysterious light. Convinced that this was a divine sign, he built a small shrine (祠) on that spot and respectfully enshrined the deity. This is the origin of Kasama Inari Shrine. Because of this legend, the shrine is also known by the affectionate name **'Walnut Tree Inari (胡桃下稲荷)'**.

The shrine's fame gradually spread, and during the Kamakura period, its prestige grew further when the lord of the Kasama domain, Kasama Tokitomo (笠間時朝), relocated the shrine to its current site and dedicated a magnificent new shrine building. In the Edo period, successive lords (藩主) of the Kasama domain revered the shrine as the domain's guardian deity. In particular, the lords of the Makino clan (牧野家) were said to have made it a point to visit and pray here for the domain's peace and prosperity every time they were summoned to Edo Castle.

However, the shrine also faced trials. In 1860 (the 1st year of Man'en, 万延元年), a great fire tragically destroyed most of the buildings, including the main hall. Yet, the deep faith of the people, cultivated over hundreds of years, was not extinguished. The Kasama domain lord, Makino Sadonaga, along with local residents and even worshippers from distant Edo, joined forces for its reconstruction. They finally succeeded in restoring the grand and beautiful shrine complex we see today. This reconstruction was more than just a construction project; it is a moving testament to the people's unwavering faith in their deity and the unity of the community.

## 2. A Stroll Through the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

With every step through the grounds of Kasama Inari Shrine, the sacred atmosphere and beautiful scenery captivate the heart. Let's walk along the path of worship and explore the main attractions within the precincts.

### 【Main Hall (本殿) & Worship Hall (拝殿)】

The Worship Hall (拝殿), standing majestically at the center of the grounds, is the first place to greet visitors. Rebuilt after the great fire of the mid-19th century, this building is a masterpiece showcasing the essence of late-Edo period shrine architecture and is designated as a **National Important Cultural Property**.

The intricate and splendid carvings adorning the eaves are particularly breathtaking. Auspicious flora and fauna such as dragons, peonies, and phoenixes are rendered so vividly they seem ready to spring to life. So exquisite are these carvings that they have earned the shrine the nickname 'Nikko of Kasama,' representing the pinnacle of craftsmanship by the best artisans of the era.

Here, visitors worship according to the "two bows, two claps, one bow" (二拝二拍手一拝) etiquette. The sound of clapping, echoing through the quiet solemnity, is a sacred ritual to announce one's presence to the deity and convey the deepest wishes of the heart. Behind the Worship Hall lies the Main Hall (本殿), the most sacred space where the deity resides, its magnificent appearance inspiring a sense of awe.

### 【Wisteria Trellis (藤棚)】

Another symbol of Kasama Inari Shrine is the pair of enormous wisteria trees located next to the Worship Hall. These ancient trees, over 400 years old, are named **'Yae-no-Fuji (八重の藤)'** and 'O-Fuji (大藤)' and are designated as Ibaraki Prefectural Natural Monuments.

Every year in early May, these trees unleash a cascade of light purple blossoms. The 'Yae-no-Fuji' is a rare variety that blooms in dense, grape-like clusters. The sweet, profound fragrance that fills the air and the dreamlike scenery before one's eyes offer an unforgettable experience to all who visit. The resilient life force of the wisteria, which has weathered centuries of storms to bloom beautifully each year, is itself considered a **'power spot'** emanating potent energy.

### 【East Gate (東門) and Tower Gate (楼門)】

The Tower Gate (楼門), which serves as the shrine's entrance, was built in 1961 and is known as one of Japan's largest stone Inari gates. As you step through its imposing structure into the grounds, you feel as though you are crossing the boundary between the everyday world and a sacred realm.

However, another gate not to be missed is the **East Gate (東門)**. Rebuilt in 1861, this gate, along with the Main Hall and Worship Hall, is a precious structure designated as a National Important Cultural Property. Though relatively modest, its wooden framework, bearing the marks of time, and its delicate decorations convey the spirit of its craftsmen. Situated in the east, which symbolizes the "creation and development of all things," this gate holds special significance for those praying for new beginnings or growth.

### 【Hidden Gems: Seitokuden Hall (聖徳殿) and Fox Statues】

Deeper within the grounds is the Seitokuden Hall (聖徳殿), dedicated to Prince Shotoku (聖徳太子). Prince Shotoku is venerated as the progenitor of Japanese crafts and technology, making this a hidden spot for people in fields like architecture and crafts to pray for success.

Additionally, throughout the grounds, you will encounter statues of **foxes (狐, kitsune)**, the messengers of the Inari deity. The foxes are depicted holding various items in their mouths, such as sheaves of rice, keys, or scrolls, each with its own meaning. These foxes are believed to be spiritual beings that deliver worshippers' prayers to the deity. Searching for these fox statues and imagining the meaning behind their expressions and postures is another enjoyable way to experience Kasama Inari Shrine.

## 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms: Mementos of Your Visit

The Goshuin and Omamori, which make the memory of your visit even more special, are precious tokens of your connection with the shrine's deity.

### 【Goshuin (御朱印)】

The Goshuin of Kasama Inari Shrine is famous for its clean and elegant calligraphy. The shrine's name, '笠間稲荷神社', is boldly written in the center, with the shrine's crest in the upper right and the vermilion shrine seal stamped vividly in the middle. Its simplicity conveys the weight and dignity of 1,370 years of history.

During the **'Tsutsuji Matsuri (つつじまつり, Azalea Festival)'** in early May, when the wisteria is in full bloom, you may be able to receive a limited-edition Goshuin featuring an additional purple stamp symbolizing the wisteria. If your travel dates align, I highly recommend obtaining this special memento of your visit. Each page filled in your Goshuin-chō (stamp book) becomes more than a collection; it is a trace of the precious connections you have forged on your pilgrimage.

### 【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】

As Kasama Inari Shrine is renowned for its blessings of business prosperity, it offers a wide variety of related omamori (charms) and engimono (lucky items).

- **Business Prosperity Charm (商売繁昌守)**: This is the most popular charm for business owners or those embarking on a new venture. Adorned with brilliant gold embroidery, simply carrying it can bestow a sense of reassurance and strength.
- **Fox-shaped Fortunes (きつねみくじ)**: This is a unique omikuji (paper fortune) where the fortune is tucked inside a cute white ceramic fox figurine. After checking your fortune, you can keep the figurine as a small decoration, making it a popular souvenir.
- **Wisteria Charm (藤守)**: Embroidered with beautiful wisteria flowers, this charm is said to bring good relationships and promote harmony in human connections. Its gentle and elegant design makes it particularly popular among female visitors.
