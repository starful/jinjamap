title: 'The Miraculous Forest Founded by Yamato Takeru 1,900 Years Ago: Walking Through
  the Red Torii Tunnel of Tokyo''s Nezu Shrine'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find sacred places like hidden gems in the city.

Today, I invite you to a place where **'the time of Edo'** miraculously remains amidst Tokyo's forest of skyscrapers. A mysterious tunnel lined with red torii gates, a place where 3,000 azalea bushes burst into bloom in spring. This is **Nezu Shrine (根津神社)**.

It is said to have been founded 1,900 years ago by the Japanese hero Yamato Takeru, and it is a place of **'miraculous good fortune (強運)'**, where buildings constructed 300 years ago have survived both war and earthquakes, remaining perfectly preserved.
From the splendid gold-leafed main hall to a stroll through the quaint alleyways (Yanesen), if you want to experience the most authentic Japanese atmosphere during your Tokyo trip, come to Nezu Shrine.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: The Land Loved by a Hero and a Shogun

A grand history is imbued in every red pillar of Nezu Shrine.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of Warding Off Evil and Prosperity】**

The shrine enshrines three deities: **Susanoo-no-Mikoto** (warding off evil), **Ōyamakui-no-kami** (mountains and industry), and **Homudawake-no-Mikoto** (luck in competition).
Thanks to this **powerful trio of deities** who ward off disaster, bring prosperity to business, and grant victory in life's challenges, countless warriors and literary figures have visited this place since ancient times.

#### **【Origin and History: A Miraculously Preserved Treasure of Edo】**

Its origins trace back 1,900 years, when Yamato Takeru first enshrined a deity here. Later, in 1706, the fifth shogun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, built the current magnificent main hall to celebrate the birth of his heir.
Amazingly, this place escaped the fires of both the Great Kanto Earthquake and the bombing of Tokyo. As a result, seven of its structures, including the main hall (Honden), worship hall (Haiden), and gates, are all designated as **National Important Cultural Properties**, perfectly showcasing the essence of the 'Gongen-zukuri' architectural style from the Edo period.

### 2. 🌺 Strolling the Grounds (Keidai): The Red Tunnel and the Hill of Flowers

Simply walking through the grounds feels like traveling through time.

#### **Senbon Torii (Thousand Torii Gates)**

The highlight of Nezu Shrine! This tunnel of red torii gates is reminiscent of Fushimi Inari in Kyoto. There's a belief that passing through from north to south **'wards off evil,'** while passing from south to north helps **'wishes come true.'** The tunnel, bathed in red light, is a perfect photo spot.

#### **Azalea Hill (Tsutsuji-en)**

Every year from mid-April to early May, the 'Tsutsuji-en' (Azalea Garden) on the shrine's hill is covered with 3,000 azalea bushes of 100 different varieties. The sight of the roundly trimmed azaleas spreading out like a colorful carpet is the main attraction of the 'Bunkyo Azalea Festival'.

#### **Otome Inari Shrine**

This is a small shrine located midway through the torii tunnel, overlooking a pond. It is called 'Otome (Maiden) Inari' because it is said to watch over women's **relationships (en-musubi)**.

#### **A Respite for Literary Masters**

This was also a favorite walking path for great Japanese writers like Natsume Soseki and Mori Ogai. Take a moment to sit on the 'Bungo no Ishi' (Literary Masters' Stone) within the grounds and lose yourself in thought.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Capturing Flowers and Seasons

Nezu Shrine's amulets and souvenirs are alive with the feeling of the seasons.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin, with '根津神社' written in calligraphy and a red seal, is simple and elegant. During the Azalea Festival, you can receive a limited-edition goshuin stamped with an **azalea seal**.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Tsukinami-bana (Monthly Flower) Charm**: From January to December, these wooden plaque charms feature a painting of the flower that symbolizes each month. Choose the flower for your birth month. They also make wonderful interior decorations.
- **Migawari (Substitute) Charm**: An amulet that is said to take on misfortune in your place.
- **En-musubi (Relationship) Charm**: A charm for relationships, imbued with the power of Otome Inari.

### 4. 🏘️ Nearby Attractions: A Stroll Through the Yanesen Alleys
