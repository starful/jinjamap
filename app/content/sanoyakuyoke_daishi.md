Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to **'Sano Yakuyoke Daishi (佐野厄除け大師)'** in Tochigi Prefecture, a short distance from Tokyo, but incredibly famous among the Japanese as a place to 'ward off evil' (yakuyoke). Its formal name is 'Soshu-ji (惣宗寺),' but because of its outstanding efficacy in warding off evil, everyone calls it 'Yakuyoke Daishi.'

The story of the legendary master who helps people safely navigate the 'unlucky years' (yakudoshi) that come at life's critical junctures, and the bizarre 'demon amulet' he left behind. Let go of your heavy heart and embark on a healing journey comforted by a warm bowl of ramen. Let's begin now.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: The Demon Master Who Defeated the Plague God

Although this is a temple, not a shrine, it is a special place deeply rooted in the faith of the Japanese people.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (Gohonzon): Gansan Daishi (Ryogen)】**

The main deity here is **Gansan Daishi (元三大師)**. He is called 'Gansan' because he passed away on January 3rd. It is said that in his lifetime, he possessed great spiritual powers and showed outstanding abilities in **warding off evil**, **preventing disasters**, and **restoring health**.
Particularly famous is the legend of **'Tsunodaishi (Horned Master)'**. When a plague was spreading, the master chanted an incantation in front of a mirror, transforming himself into a horned, skeletal demon to drive away the plague god. Amulets depicting this form are still considered the best evil-warding charms in Japan.

#### **【Origins and History: The Meeting of a Hero and a High Priest】**

In 944, the legendary warrior **Fujiwara no Hidesato** founded the temple. He was a valiant general famous for the 'Legend of the Centipede Slayer.' After suppressing a rebellion, he invited Gansan Daishi, the most revered high priest of the time, to establish this temple.
For over a thousand years, this place has soothed the sorrows of the common people and averted calamities, making it one of the three great Daishi temples in the Kanto region.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Golden Bell and Purification of the Heart

The precincts are not large, but every step is filled with spiritual energy.

#### **The Golden Temple Bell and Main Hall**

Upon entering the grounds, the dazzling **Golden Temple Bell** catches your eye. Its sound is said to purify the mind and drive away negative energy. In the magnificent main hall, the **'Goma (Homa) prayer'** is held several times a day. The ritual of burning wooden amulets in the roaring flames to dispel misfortune is a cathartic experience just to watch.

#### **Reisen (Sacred Spring) and Zeniarai (Money Washing)**

Within the precincts, there is a **'Reisen'** (sacred spring) where clear water gushes forth. It is said that washing money in the flowing water in front of the 'Zeniarai Benten' statue here will increase your financial luck. Keep the washed money in your wallet as 'seed money'!

#### **Statue of Tsunodaishi**

He may look frightening, but he's actually a reliable guardian deity! Look for the statue of **'Tsunodaishi'**. His skeletal ribs and horned appearance are said to make all evil spirits flee in terror.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: The Ultimate Evil-Warding Amulets

The temple offers a wide array of items specializing in warding off misfortune.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin from Sano Yakuyoke Daishi exudes the power of calligraphy. In the center, the characters **'厄除元三大師 (Yakuyoke Ganzan Daishi)'** are written, and a red seal is stamped. Limited-edition versions with gold lettering are available during the New Year or special periods, so be sure to check.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Tsunodaishi Amulet**: The signature item here! It's a paper talisman (ofuda) with a depiction of Gansan Daishi in his demon form. Placing it at your entrance prevents bad energy from entering the house. (Sticker versions are also available!)
- **Evil-Warding Charm (Yakuyoke Omamori)**: An essential item for those in their unlucky years (`yakudoshi`).
- **Traffic Safety Sticker**: The car sticker featuring Tsunodaishi is quite famous among Japanese drivers.

#### **2. Sano Premium Outlets**
