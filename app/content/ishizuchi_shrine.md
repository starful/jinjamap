Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **'Mt. Ishizuchi (石鎚山, 1982m)'**, the highest mountain in Shikoku, known as the garden of the gods above the clouds. Here, boasting a spiritual power as formidable as its rugged terrain, lies **'Ishizuchi Shrine (石鎚神社)'**, which worships the entire mountain as its sacred body (shintai).

This is one of Japan's Seven Sacred Mountains, a place where countless ascetics risked their lives to climb in pursuit of enlightenment. It features giant chains hanging from cliffs, the 'Jojusha' where wishes are said to come true, and a mystical nature where clear water springs forth.
This is a special pilgrimage for those who wish to go beyond simple sightseeing, test their limits, and gain new strength. Let's begin now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Where the Mountain Itself Became a God

The history of Ishizuchi Shrine is intertwined with the human will to overcome harsh nature.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The God of Wish Fulfillment】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Ishizuchi-no-kami**. This is the personification of Mt. Ishizuchi itself, known as the god of **'fulfilling all wishes (諸願成就)'**.
It is believed to possess a powerful force that heals illnesses, protects families, and helps overcome any difficulty to achieve one's goals. The belief that "if you wish for it earnestly, it will surely come true" is the power that has sustained this place.

#### **【Origin and History: The Challenge of En no Gyoja】**

1,300 years ago, the legendary ascetic **En no Gyoja** was drawn by the mountain's spiritual power and climbed its treacherous cliffs. Reaching the summit, he met the mountain god and opened this place as a center for ascetic training (Oyamabiraki).
Since then, countless yamabushi (mountain ascetics) have trained themselves by climbing the mountain relying on chains. The four shrines that stretch from the foot of the mountain to the summit (Honsha, Jojusha, Yohai-den, and Chojosha) symbolize the stages of this training.

### 2. ⛰️ A Walk Through the Precincts: The Journey to the Mountain of the Gods

The Ishizuchi Shrine pilgrimage begins at 'Kuchi-no-miya Honsha' at the foot of the mountain.

#### **Kuchi-no-miya Honsha: A Grand Start**

Located at the mountain's entrance, the Honsha is a magnificent wooden structure. Here, first purify your body and mind, and pray for a safe hike and the fulfillment of your wishes. Don't forget to wash your hands under the red bridge, **'Shinkyo'**, which crosses the clear Kamogawa River.

#### **Jojusha (成就社): The Place Where Wishes Come True**

Take the ropeway up to the mid-slope of the mountain (1,450m above sea level) and you will find **'Jojusha'**. This is the legendary place where En no Gyoja fulfilled his wish at the end of his training. The panoramic view of the Shikoku Mountains from here is breathtaking. Cleanse your spirit with clear mountain water at the **'Misogiba (purification site)'**.

#### **Chain Climb (Kusari): Challenging Your Limits**

On the path to the summit, four giant chains hang from the cliffs: the **'Trial Chain (74m)'**, **'First Chain (33m)'**, **'Second Chain (65m)'**, and **'Third Chain (68m)'**.
Climbing the near-vertical rock face relying on just one chain requires immense courage. (Don't worry, there are detours!) However, the sense of accomplishment you feel upon reaching the top is irreplaceable.

#### **Chojosha (頂上社): The Place Where Heaven and Earth Meet**

This is a small shrine located at the summit of Mt. Ishizuchi, 1,982m above sea level. It feels like meeting the gods above the clouds; this is truly a celestial place.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: A Proof of Accomplishment

The items received at the end of a difficult journey are all the more precious.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

At Ishizuchi Shrine, each of the four shrines (Honsha, Jojusha, Yohai-den, and Chojosha) has a different goshuin. Collecting all four is a mark of a complete pilgrimage and a badge of honor.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Wish Fulfillment Charm**: A charm imbued with the powerful energy of Ishizuchi-no-kami. Recommended for those striving to achieve their goals.
- **Strong Legs Charm (Kenkyaku Mamori)**: Protects the safety and leg health of climbers. It also makes a great gift for parents.
- **Tengu Charm**: A charm depicting a Tengu (a mountain goblin) that guards the mountain, warding off bad luck.

### 4. 🚠 Nearby Attractions: Saijo, the City of Water

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the charms of Saijo City, the 'City of Water'.

#### **1. Ishizuchi Tozan Ropeway**

- **Features**: Allows you to comfortably ascend to 1,300m above sea level without a strenuous hike. The autumn foliage or snowy landscapes unfolding below are breathtaking.

#### **2. Saijo Uchinuki (Spring Water)**

- **Features**: Meltwater from Mt. Ishizuchi flows underground and springs up throughout the city. This clear water, called **'Uchinuki'**, is listed among the 100 best waters of Japan. Bring a water bottle to taste it for yourself.

#### **3. Kosaryo Ichi (Mountain Lodge Cafe)**

- **Location**: Near Jojusha.
- **Menu**: A warm bowl of sansai udon (mountain vegetable udon) and freshly brewed coffee taste divine after a hike. It's a great place to relax while enjoying the view from the window.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Ishizuchi Shrine is not a relaxing resort. It is an intense arena where you sweat, gasp for breath, confront your inner weaknesses, and overcome them.
But the wind at the summit and the sense of accomplishment you experience at the end of this process will become a powerful energy that can change your life.

Do you have a dream you want to challenge? A mountain you need to overcome? Then come to Ishizuchi Shrine. The mountain god will silently watch over your challenge and lend you strength.
