Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find Japan's hidden sacred sites.

Today, I invite you to the deep forests of Toyama Prefecture, a land where snow-capped mountains meet the blue sea. Nestled there is **Takase Shrine (高瀬神社)**, which has served as the spiritual pillar of this region since ancient times, known as the 'Echigo Ichinomiya (越中一宮)'.

This is no ordinary shrine. It is steeped in the legend that the land was personally pioneered by Okuninushi-no-Mikoto, the hero of Japan's founding myths and the 'god of matchmaking.' It is also a sacred place of healing, where a mystical 'rabbit (Nade-usagi)' that is said to cure ailments greets visitors.

For over 2,000 years, Takase Shrine has been a place where warriors prayed for victory and the common people's pains were soothed. As you walk along the path lined with lush cedar trees, you'll find your heart's burdens lifted and filled with new hope. Let's journey there now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Building a Nation and Forging Bonds

To understand the depth of a shrine, one must first encounter its resident deity and history. Takase Shrine enshrines a superstar of Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The All-Powerful God, Okuninushi】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Okuninushi-no-Mikoto (大国主命)**. Along with Amaterasu of Ise Grand Shrine, he is one of the most famous and beloved gods in Japan. He is truly an 'all-powerful god' with a wide range of abilities.

- **God of Nation-Building**: As the deity who pioneered the land of Japan and established agriculture and industry, he ensures **business prosperity (商売繁盛)** and **success**.
- **God of Matchmaking (Enmusubi)**: Befitting a protagonist of numerous romances, he forges not only romantic love between men and women but all kinds of **good relationships (良縁)**, including meetings with good people and connections with work.
- **God of Medicine and Healing**: A compassionate deity who took pity on the sick and spread knowledge of medicine and herbs, he aids in **long life free from illness** and **recovery from sickness**. The tale of him saving the 'White Hare of Inaba' particularly symbolizes his healing powers.

#### **【Origins and History: Footprints of the God Who Pioneered Echigo】**

According to myth, after ceding the country to the descendants of the heavenly gods, Okuninushi and his son sailed to and landed in this land of Echigo (Toyama). It is said that he transformed this once-rugged wasteland into a prosperous paradise by teaching farming methods, weaving techniques, and medicine. In gratitude for his blessings, the people built a shrine at the rapids (takase, 高瀬) where he landed, marking the beginning of Takase Shrine.

Historically, its status was immense. It was recorded as a 'Myojin Taisha' (a nationally important shrine) in the 10th-century legal text "Engishiki," and was designated as the **'Ichinomiya' (一宮)**, the highest-ranking shrine in all of Echigo Province (Toyama Prefecture), receiving veneration from the imperial court and warriors alike. The Warring States period hero Uesugi Kenshin is also said to have visited here to pray for victory in battle, which attests to its spiritual
