title: 'Jishu Shrine, Kyoto''s Ultimate Romantic Sanctuary: The Jomon Period''s Love
  Stones and a Three-Year Wait'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to romantic sanctuaries around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a very special red shrine hidden within Kiyomizu-dera Temple, the highlight of any Kyoto trip. It's a place where you'll see the unique sight of countless couples and young people walking between two stones with their eyes closed. This is **'Jishu Shrine (地主神社)'**.

This is one of Japan's oldest and most famous sanctuaries for **'Enmusubi' (matchmaking)**. Although it is currently **closed for major renovation work until 2025**, its fame and spiritual power still linger in the Kyoto sky. Let's begin our virtual pilgrimage into the romantic myths and the message of love conveyed by stones that are 3,000 years old.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Cupid of Love, Okuninushi

What kind of god resides behind the red torii gate of Jishu Shrine?

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Okuninushi and His Family】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Okuninushi-no-Mikoto**. In Japanese mythology, he is the most popular and romantic figure, a hero who fell in love with and married numerous goddesses to build his nation. He is especially famous for his kind heart, demonstrated when he saved an injured white hare.
His parents, Susanoo (disaster prevention) and Kushinadahime (marital harmony), as well as his grandparents, are also enshrined here, creating the ultimate "love avengers" team that protects **romance, marriage, and family peace**.

#### **【Origin and History: A Land Older Than Kiyomizu-dera】**

The site of Jishu Shrine has been considered sacred since ancient times, long before Kiyomizu-dera was built. In fact, scientific analysis has revealed that the **'Love Stones'** within the precincts are relics from the **Jomon period (before Christ)**. This means that people have been offering prayers here since before the founding of Japan.
Originally the guardian shrine of Kiyomizu-dera, it became independent during the Meiji period. Today, it is registered as a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** along with Kiyomizu-dera, a testament to its value.

### 2. ❤️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Walking to Love with Eyes Closed

Jishu Shrine may be small, but it is filled with a powerful energy of love. Here are the must-see spots.

#### **The Love-Fortune Stones (Koi-uranai-no-ishi)**

This is the symbol and highlight of Jishu Shrine! These are two knee-high stones placed about 10 meters apart in front of the main hall.

- **The Legend**: It is said that if you can walk from one stone to the other with your eyes closed, your love will be fulfilled.
- **The Challenge**: A fun superstition says that if you succeed on the first try, your love will come true quickly. If you fail a few times, it will be delayed. If you reach the stone with a friend's help, you will find love with someone's assistance.

#### **Ornate Main Hall and Worship Hall**

Rebuilt in 1633 by Tokugawa Iemitsu, the main hall (Honden) and worship hall (Haiden) are designated as Important Cultural Properties, notable for their vibrant colors and intricate carvings. The vermilion pillars and gold decorations are as intense as the passion of love.

#### **Nade Daikoku (The Stroking Daikoku)**

Make a wish while stroking the statue of the god Okuninushi (also known as Daikoku).

- **Mallet**: Good fortune and wealth
- **Belly**: Safe childbirth and health
- **Head**: Academic success and wisdom
Gently stroke the part that corresponds to your wish.

#### **Hitogata-harai (Paper Doll Purification)**

Write your name on a paper doll (hitogata), breathe onto it your ailments or worries, and then float it on the water. It is believed that as the paper dissolves and disappears, so too will your bad luck. It's also a good way to wash away the pain of a broken heart.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Catch Some Pink-Colored Luck

The items offered at Jishu Shrine are the embodiment of loveliness.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

In the center is the bold calligraphy of **'地主神社 (Jishu Shrine)'**, accompanied by a red **'縁むすび (Enmusubi)'** stamp. Just having this stamp makes you feel like a good connection is on its way.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Vow of Love Amulet**: An amulet for couples to share as they pledge their love to each other.
- **Cupid Amulet**: Featuring Cupid with his arrow, this amulet is recommended for those hoping to win over their crush.
- **Zodiac Amulet**: Choose the amulet that corresponds to your own star sign.

### 4. 🏯 Nearby Attractions: A Romantic Stroll in Kyoto

The area around Jishu Shrine and Kiyomizu-dera is the essence of a Kyoto trip.

#### **1. Kiyomizu-dera Temple**

- **Features**: The view of Kyoto city from the massive wooden stage built on the edge of a cliff (**the Stage of Kiyomizu**) is breathtaking. At the **'Otowa Waterfall,'** you can drink from one of the three streams to wish for health, academic success, or longevity in love.

#### **2. Sannenzaka & Ninenzaka**

- **Features**: These are the stone-paved slopes leading down from Kiyomizu-dera. Lined with shops and tea houses in renovated traditional buildings, they are perfect for soaking in the atmosphere of Kyoto. Walk carefully, as a scary (?) legend says that if you fall here, you'll die within three years!

#### **3. % Arabica Kyoto**

- **Features**: A popular cafe located in an alley with a view of the Yasaka Pagoda. Strolling through the streets with a delicious latte in hand is the perfect way to recharge your Kyoto spirit!

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Right now, Jishu Shrine is taking a short break. The 3,000-year-old stones and the brilliant main hall are being refurbished to welcome us back, stronger and more beautiful than ever.
