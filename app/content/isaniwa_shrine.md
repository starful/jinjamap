Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll be guiding you to Matsuyama City in Ehime Prefecture. This is home to the 3,000-year-old "Dogo Onsen (道後温泉)," said to be a model for the setting of the Japanese anime "Spirited Away." Amidst the streets filled with the languid, warm air unique to a hot spring town, a steep stone staircase stretching toward the sky captures the traveler's gaze.

After climbing the 135 steps, short of breath, a magnificent and solemn vermilion sanctuary unfolds before your eyes, as if a palace from Kyoto had been transported here. This is **Isaniwa Shrine (伊佐爾波神社)**.

This is not just an observatory. It is a powerful spot for those praying for victory in competitions, imbued with the earnest wish for "certain victory" from a samurai of the Edo period. It is also a treasure, designated as a National Important Cultural Property for its rare architectural style, one of the finest in Japan. Before healing your body in the hot springs, shall we embark on a pilgrimage with me to Isaniwa Shrine, a place to purify your mind and receive the energy of victory?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Samurai's Vow for Victory

Before you marvel at the shrine's magnificent exterior, understanding the stories of the gods and the history enshrined here will make each crimson pillar appear in a new light. Isaniwa Shrine is a "Hachimangu (八幡宮)," which enshrines the ancestral deity of the Japanese Imperial family and the god of military fortune.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Guardians of Victory and Life】**

At the heart of Isaniwa Shrine are three major deities from Japanese history and mythology.

- **Homudawake-no-Mikoto (誉田別尊 / Emperor Ojin)**:
  The 15th emperor and the main deity "Hachiman Okami (八幡大神)" worshipped at Hachiman shrines across Japan. Since ancient times, he has been revered as a powerful god of war who **protects the nation, wards off evil, and grants certain victory in battles and competitions (必勝祈願)**. In modern times, he is sought by people facing important challenges in life, such as entrance exams, job hunting, and business ventures.

- **Okinagatarashihime-no-Mikoto (息長帯姫命 / Empress Jingu)**:
  The mother of Emperor Ojin. She is a legendary heroine who went to the battlefield while pregnant, achieved victory, and gave birth to her child safely. Thanks to this tale, she is worshipped as a guardian of **safe childbirth (安産) and child-rearing (子育て)**, as well as a deity who brings **luck in victory (勝運)** with the strong power of a mother.

- **Tarashinakatsuhiko-no-Mikoto (足仲彦尊 / Emperor Chuai)**:
  The husband of Empress Jingu and the father of Emperor Ojin. The enshrinement of the family deities together also signifies the protection of household peace.

#### **【Origins and History: The Miracle of Yabusame】**

The origins of Isaniwa Shrine trace back to the age of mythology. It is said to have begun when Emperor Chuai and Empress Jingu visited Dogo Onsen, bathed, and were so impressed by its efficacy that they enshrined a deity on the hill. At that time, it was called "Yu-no-oka (Hill of Hot Water)" and also served as the guardian of the onsen.

However, the shrine acquired its current splendid form thanks to a dramatic event during the Edo period.
Matsudaira Sadanaga, the third lord of the Matsuyama domain, was ordered by the Edo shogunate to perform **yabusame (流鏑馬, a form of mounted archery)** in front of the shogun. This was a once-in-a-lifetime challenge with the clan's honor at stake. In this critical situation where failure could bring shame upon his family, Sadanaga visited Isaniwa Shrine and prayed earnestly.

**"If you grant me success in this competition, I will rebuild your sanctuary in splendor and offer it to you."**

Was it thanks to his prayers? He hit the targets perfectly without a single mistake. To keep his promise, in 1667, he gathered the best craftsmen of the era and completed the current magnificent sanctuary, modeled after the Iwashimizu Hachimangu in Kyoto. In other words, Isaniwa Shrine is proof of an **'absolute victory'** and a masterpiece born from the integrity of a samurai who kept his promise.

### 2. ⛩️ A Walk Through the Grounds: A Different World Atop 135 Steps

A short walk from Dogo Onsen Station, past the shopping arcade, reveals a massive stone staircase. This is where the journey into the sacred realm begins.

#### **The 135 Stone Steps and the Romon (楼門)**

The 135 steep steps feel like a path of ascetic training. You may find yourself out of breath with each step, but the ever-changing view of the Dogo town below offers some comfort. At the top of the stairs, a grand two-story gate, the **Romon (楼門)**, welcomes pilgrims. Take a moment to look back from here. It's a viewpoint offering a panoramic vista of the town, including the Dogo Onsen Main Building.

#### **National Important Cultural Property: The Aesthetics of Hachiman-zukuri (八幡造)**

The precinct beyond the Romon is a world of vivid vermilion.
The most noteworthy feature is the unique structure of the main hall (Honden) and the worship hall (Haiden). It is built in the **'Hachiman-zukuri'** style, a rare form found in only three places in all of Japan.
In Hachiman-zukuri, the Honden, where the deity resides, and the Haiden, where people pray, are placed one behind the other and connected by a single massive roof, creating the appearance of twin buildings joined together. The elegant curves of the roof, the brilliant colors of the pillars, and the intricate carvings showcase the essence of Edo-period architecture. (It is counted among Japan's three great Hachiman-zukuri, along with Usa Jingu in Oita and Iwashimizu Hachimangu in Kyoto.)

#### **The Corridor (回廊) and Hidden Power Spots**

The long, U-shaped corridor surrounding the main hall is also an Important Cultural Property. Take a slow walk through this corridor, where the vermilion pillars seem to stretch on endlessly.

- **Wasan Tablets**: On the corridor walls hang 'Sangaku (算額),' wooden tablets on which people in the Edo period solved mathematical problems and dedicated them to the gods. They are not only materials showing the high intellectual level of the time but also bestow good fortune upon those wishing for academic achievement.
- **Houkaku Shrine**: A small shrine on the side of the precinct, it is a hidden gem for couples wishing for children or praying for a safe delivery.
- **Sacred Camphor Trees (楠)**: In the lush forest behind the main hall, ancient camphor trees exude a sacred aura. It's a good idea to meditate for a moment while feeling the breeze from the forest.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms: Keeping a Token of Victory

After your prayers, it's time to take home the samurai's spirit of certain victory.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Isaniwa Shrine is bold and powerful. The red seal of **'伊佐爾波神社 (Isaniwa Jinja)'** stamped in the center and the dynamic calligraphy seem to express a strong will to achieve victory. It is more than a simple souvenir; it is a worthy keepsake, a personal "talisman for certain victory."

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Shoun (Victory Luck) Omamori**: The representative amulet, featuring the true story of Matsudaira Sadanaga's yabusame success. Adorned with a bow and arrow, this charm is the perfect gift for students, job seekers, and athletes.
- **Safe Childbirth Amulet**: An amulet blessed with the protection of Empress Jingu, popular among expectant mothers.
- **Hatomikuji (Pigeon Fortune)**: A fortune slip is hidden inside a ceramic pigeon, the messenger of the Hachiman deity. The cute pigeon figurine is said to bring good luck when displayed at home.
