Hello, this is an editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to introduce you to the hidden gems of travel.

Today, I want to invite you to a quiet and peaceful town in the southern part of Fukuoka Prefecture, Chikugo City. As you stroll through the expansive grounds of Mizuta Tenmangu, steeped in the scent of profound history, you'll discover a small shrine that radiates a uniquely warm and gentle aura, like a gateway to a fairytale world. Its very name evokes a sense of romance: **'Koinoki Shrine (恋木神社)'**.

Did you know that this is the only shrine in all of Japan with the character for 'love' (恋) in its name?
From the entrance to the main hall, the entire shrine is filled with pink heart motifs, creating a romantic atmosphere that could make anyone fall in love the moment they visit. However, this place is more than just an 'Instagrammable' photo spot. Behind its vibrant pink facade lies a poignant narrative of one man's deep longing and profound love for his family, a story that has been passed down for over 1,000 years.

This is a sacred space that goes beyond simple romantic fulfillment to forge true 'bonds' between people. Let's begin our pilgrimage to Koinoki Shrine, where every stone step and every leaf is imbued with a legend of love.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: When Love and Longing Became a God

Before being captivated by the shrine's splendid appearance, we must first listen to the story of its resident deity and the background of its birth. Once you understand the depth of the tale Koinoki Shrine holds, the heart patterns before your eyes will feel even more special.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Japan's Only Koinomikoto】**

At the heart of Koinoki Shrine sits a very rare and special deity named **'Koinomikoto (恋命)'**. Among the eight million gods of Japan, this is the one and only being whose divine name directly incorporates 'love' (恋). As the name suggests, it is a god who governs love, watching over the precious emotions in the hearts of all who visit.

But Koinomikoto's power is not limited to romance between men and women.

- **Good Match (良縁)**: For those yet to find a partner, it brings a fateful encounter.
- **Marital Harmony (夫婦円満)**: For married couples, it fosters deep affection and care for each other.
- **Harmony in Relationships**: It possesses a broad benevolence that strengthens all positive connections between people, including friends, colleagues, and family.

Perhaps that's why the shrine grounds are perpetually filled with people of all generations who cherish love, from teenagers dreaming of their first romance to elderly couples visiting hand in hand.

#### **【Origin and History: A Familial Love Spanning a Thousand Years】**

Not many people know that the origin of this lovely shrine actually began with a heart-wrenchingly sorrowful farewell and longing. To find the roots of Koinoki Shrine, we must look into the life of the main deity of 'Mizuta Tenmangu' to which it belongs, **Sugawara no Michizane (菅原道真)**.

Michizane, the greatest scholar and politician of the Heian period, suffered the misfortune of being demoted overnight from Kyoto to Dazaifu in Kyushu due to the slander of his political rivals. At the time, being sent to Dazaifu was essentially a sentence of death by exile. What tormented him most was the fact that he had to leave his beloved wife and young children behind in Kyoto and depart alone.

Life in the unfamiliar land of Dazaifu was solitary. He never forgot his family, not even for a moment until his death, and would often gaze at the Kyoto sky to soothe his piercing longing. His famous poem, *"When the east wind blows, send me your fragrance, O plum blossoms. Although your master is gone, do not forget the spring,"* fully captures his desperate feelings for his family and hometown.

In 1231 (Kamakura period), Mizuta Tenmangu was built here to console the spirit of Michizane. It was then that Michizane's lifelong **'heart of longing and adoration for his family (恋い慕う御心)'** was itself separated and deified, marking the beginning of Koinoki Shrine.

In other words, Koinomikoto was not a deity that existed from the beginning of time, but rather **the embodiment of a single human's pure and noble love and longing, sublimated into a faith over a thousand years**. The legend that camellia trees, traditionally called 'koinoki (love trees),' grew naturally around the shrine adds to the romance of this mystical origin story. The countless hearts we encounter here are not mere decorations, but symbols of the purest and most powerful love that transcends time and space.

### 2. 💖 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Thrill of Walking the Path of Hearts

The grounds of Koinoki Shrine are like a 'theme park of love.' The symbols of love you discover with every step will make your heart flutter and render your moment of prayer even more special.

#### **【Koi-sando (恋参道): The Path to Love】**

After passing through the shrine's torii gate, the first thing you'll see is the path called **'Koi-sando.'** Look closely at your feet. Heart-shaped ceramic tiles are embedded like stepping stones along the path. A total of ten hearts lead to the main hall, and legend has it that if you walk this path stepping on each heart, the love in your heart will be fulfilled. Resembling our own journey of taking courageous steps toward love, this path provides a heart-pounding experience from the very start of your visit.

#### **【Main Hall and the Inome (猪目) Pattern】**

The worship hall you encounter at the end of the Koi-sando is small but elegant. A key point not to be missed here is the shrine's crest (神紋). The patterns adorning the hall are unmistakably heart-shaped. In fact, this is a traditional Japanese architectural pattern called **'Inome (猪目),'** which depicts a wild boar's eye. It has been used since ancient times to ward off disasters and bring good fortune, but at Koinoki Shrine, its resemblance to a heart has led to its use as a 'symbol that calls for love and happiness.' The witty and exquisite blend of tradition and modern sensibility is remarkable.

Worship follows the formal etiquette of **'Nirei Nihakushu Ichirei (二礼二拍手一礼)'** (Two bows, two claps, one bow).

1. Place a coin in the offering box.
2. Bow deeply at a 90-degree angle twice.
3. Clap your hands twice at chest height (the trick is to slightly lower your right hand before clapping!).
4. Bring your hands together and earnestly pray for love.
5. Finally, bow deeply once more.
    Your heartfelt prayer will reach Koinomikoto and return to you as a warm response.

#### **【Meotoiwa (夫婦岩) and the Couple Gourd】**

Next to the main hall, two large rocks that look as if they could withstand any storm are bound firmly together by a thick sacred rope (shimenawa). These are the **'Meotoiwa (Couple Rocks).'** Symbolizing the creator couple of Japanese mythology, these rocks represent an unbreakable bond of fate. It is said that if a couple holds hands and prays before these rocks, their love will last forever.

Beside them is an adorable stone gourd statue, the **'Koimusubi Hyotan.'** Stroking this gourd, which resembles a pair of Hina dolls, is said to bring not only marital harmony but also the blessings of prosperity for descendants and safe childbirth. It's a must-visit spot for those who dream of a smooth and happy family life, much like the round curves of the gourd.

#### **【The Sacred Nagi Tree (なぎの木): An Unbreakable Bond】**

Standing quietly in a corner of the grounds, the **'Nagi Tree'** is Koinoki Shrine's hidden power spot. The leaves of this tree have strong vertical veins, making them incredibly tough and difficult to tear horizontally. Because of this characteristic, it has long been regarded as a sacred tree that protects the bond of marriage, symbolizing a 'connection that cannot be broken.' A story is told of wives giving these leaves to their husbands heading to the battlefield as a token of their safe return and unchanging love. Take a deep breath under the tree and feel the power of a strong love that remains unshaken by any trial.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms: Cherishing a Pink Memory

Once you've finished your prayers, it's time to preserve that感動 in a physical form. The charms and souvenirs from Koinoki Shrine are so lovely that just looking at them will bring a smile to your face.

#### **【The Pink Goshuin with a Heart Stamp】**

Even among Goshuin collectors, the one from Koinoki Shrine is considered a 'must-have item.' This is because it uses a delicate pink-hued paper instead of the usual white paper. The shrine's name, written in elegant calligraphy, is accompanied by a vividly stamped red, heart-shaped crest, making it look like a work of art.
Even more ornate limited-edition Goshuin are said to appear during Valentine's Day in February and Hinamatsuri (Doll's Festival) in March, so it might be a good idea to time your visit.

#### **【Omamori to Protect Your Love】**

- **Heart-shaped Ceramic Charm (陶器おまもり)**: This is the most popular item. The smooth, heart-shaped ceramic piece is inscribed with the character for 'love' (恋) or 'bond' (縁). Thanks to its brilliant colors and cute shape, it's perfect for attaching to a bag or pouch.
- **Ring of Happiness Charm**: A unique charm that comes with a ring inside a small box. If you wish for a one-sided love to be returned, wear it on your left ring finger; if you want to protect your current love, wear it on your right ring finger. It makes a wonderful gift for yourself or a friend.
- **Koimikuji (Love Fortune)**: Try drawing an omikuji (fortune slip) made of pink paper. The fortune, specialized for love, will guide your romantic path. If the result is not good, you can tie it up within the shrine grounds and leave the bad luck behind. The sight of countless heart-shaped omikuji fluttering in the wind is also a magnificent view.

### 4. 🍜 Nearby Attractions: The Tastes and Charms of Chikugo

Carrying the excitement from Koinoki Shrine, why not explore more of the simple yet deep charms of the Chikugo area?

#### **1. Mizuta Tenmangu (水田天満宮)**

This is the main shrine (本社) that houses Koinoki Shrine. If you prayed for love at Koinoki, you can pray to Michizane here for academic success or wisdom. It has the second-oldest history in Kyushu after Dazaifu Tenmangu, and its serene garden and ancient architecture offer a comforting appeal.

#### **2. Tanuki no Sato Udon (たぬきの里うどん)**

Fukuoka is as famous for its udon as it is for its tonkotsu ramen. The udon in the Chikugo region is particularly known for its soft texture. 'Tanuki no Sato,' a 5-minute drive from the shrine, is a popular spot where locals line up to eat. A bowl of **'Goboten Udon,'** topped with crispy burdock root tempura, will surely melt away your travel fatigue.

#### **3. HAZE Reading Room & Cafe (HAZE読書室と喫茶)**

If you want to calmly gather your thoughts after your shrine visit, this is the place to go. It's a book cafe in a renovated old house, where you can enjoy fragrant coffee and homemade cake in a tranquility that feels as if time has stopped. The peaceful countryside view from the window is an added bonus.
