title: 'A Forest with the Spirit of Hokkaido''s Pioneers: Meet Squirrels and Make
  Wishes Come True at Obihiro Shrine'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' traveling to find hidden gem-like sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Obihiro (帯広), the center of the vast Tokachi Plain on the great land of Hokkaido. A place steeped in the sweat and tears of pioneers who cultivated the rugged land with their bare hands 100 years ago. And it is the fairytale-like sacred site, **'Obihiro Shrine (帯広神社)'**, where the forest fairy, the **'Ezo Risu (Hokkaido squirrel)'**, frolics.

From the dense forest path that makes you forget the city noise, to the goshuin with squirrel illustrations that change with the seasons, and even Obihiro's famous butadon. Shall we embark on a healing journey to Obihiro Shrine, a place where history, nature, and gastronomy blend together?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Pioneer Gods Who Turned Wasteland into Fertile Soil

The roots of Obihiro Shrine are deeply connected to the history of Hokkaido's pioneering era.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Three Pioneer Gods】**

This shrine enshrines three deities: **Okuninushi (nation-building)**, **Onamuchi (another name for Okuninushi)**, and **Sukunahikona (medicine and agriculture)**.
They are all mythological heroes who pioneered the wild lands and enriched people's lives. Therefore, Obihiro Shrine is believed to bring powerful blessings for **'business prosperity'**, **'bountiful harvests'**, **'household safety'**, and **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'**.

#### **【Origins and History: Sowing the Seeds of Hope】**

In 1883, the 'Banseisha' pioneer group, led by Benzo Yoda from Shizuoka, took their first steps in Obihiro. Despite the -30°C cold and starvation, they did not lose hope and established this shrine in 1910 as a spiritual sanctuary.
This place, imbued with the indomitable will of the pioneers, remains a power spot that gives great courage to those starting new challenges today.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Encountering Friends of the Forest

Although not far from the city center, once you enter the shrine grounds, a sense of peace envelops you, as if you've entered a deep forest.

#### **Find the Ezo Risu (Squirrels)!**

The mascot of Obihiro Shrine is undoubtedly the **'Ezo Risu'**. On an early morning walk along the approach, you can often spot adorable squirrels scurrying between the trees. Their appearance, approaching people without fear as if they were messengers of the gods, creates an unforgettable memory. (Please take photos quietly!)

#### **The Haiden (Main Hall) and a Forest Walk**

Offer your prayers in front of the simple yet majestic haiden (main hall) with the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' ritual. After praying, take a walk along the forest path lined with giant oaks and elms, and breathe in plenty of phytoncides.

#### **Hidden Power Spot: Sazare-ishi**

Next to the haiden is the **'Sazare-ishi (Pebble Rock)'**, which is mentioned in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem. Just as small pebbles gather to become a large boulder, this is a place to pray for **family harmony** and **unity**.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Items: Happiness Delivered by Squirrels

The items offered at Obihiro Shrine are cuteness itself.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here are famous among collectors. This is because they are stamped with an **Ezo Risu design that changes with the seasons**! A squirrel with cherry blossoms in spring, or with an acorn in autumn—it's great fun to collect the different designs each time you visit.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Shimarisu Omamori**: An amulet embroidered with a cute chipmunk. It is said to bring **'happiness'**, making it a very popular gift.
- **Squirrel Mikuji**: A fortune slip is tucked inside a carved wooden squirrel figurine. You can take the squirrel home to display as a decoration.
- **Enmusubi Amulet**: Recommended for those hoping for a good relationship.
