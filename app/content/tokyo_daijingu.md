### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Sun Goddess and Gods of Creation Descended Upon Tokyo

First, let's discover the deep-rooted story of why Tokyo Daijingu is called the 'Sacred Place of Relationships'.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): An All-Star Lineup】**

The shrine enshrines the main deities of Ise Grand Shrine: **Amaterasu Sumeōkami (the Sun Goddess)** and **Toyouke-no-Ōkami (the God of Abundance)**. In addition, it also enshrines the three deities known as the **'Zōka Sanshin (造化の三神)'** (the three gods of creation: Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi, and Kamimusubi), who govern the creation and **'tying together (musubi)'** of all things.
The power of this 'musubi' acts as a strong energy that forges connections between men and women, making Tokyo Daijingu a renowned spot for finding love.

#### **【Origin and History: The Birthplace of Shrine Weddings】**

During the Meiji era, the Emperor expressed his wish for people to be able to worship Ise Grand Shrine in Tokyo as well. In 1880, the Ise Grand Shrine Yōhaiden (Worship Hall from a Distance), the predecessor of today's Tokyo Daijingu, was established in Hibiya.
In 1900, following the wedding of the Crown Prince (later Emperor Taishō) at the Imperial Palace sanctuary, the public's desire to hold their own weddings before the gods grew. In response, Tokyo Daijingu conducted the **first-ever Shinto wedding ceremony for the general public in Japan** in 1901. This became the origin of modern Japanese traditional wedding culture, naturally establishing the formula: 'Marriage = Relationships = Tokyo Daijingu'.

### 2. 💖 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Finding Hearts Full of Excitement

The shrine grounds are not large, but they are filled with a charming and lovely atmosphere. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Finding Hidden Hearts (Inome Pattern)**

Look closely at the metal ornaments and wood carvings on the shrine buildings. You'll find heart-shaped patterns hidden in various spots. These are actually a traditional pattern called **'Inome (猪の目),'** which means 'boar's eye,' and is meant to ward off evil spirits. Here, however, it's known as a **'heart that grants love.'** There's a popular belief that finding these hidden hearts, taking a picture, and setting it as your phone's wallpaper will boost your luck in love, so be sure to give it a try!

#### **The Sacred Tree and Pure Water**

Take a deep breath under the giant sacred tree (神木, shinboku) next to the main hall and feel its pure energy. Don't forget to purify your body and mind with the water flowing from the dragon sculpture at the temizuya (hand-washing pavilion) near the entrance.

#### **Iitomi Inari Shrine**

On one side of the grounds, you'll find the 'Iitomi Inari Shrine' with its impressive red torii gates. It enshrines the god of food, clothing, shelter, and business prosperity. It is said to be particularly effective for those dreaming of a career in the entertainment industry, attracting many aspiring celebrities.

The items available at Tokyo Daijingu are famous for their beauty. They make for perfect gifts as well.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Lily of the Valley Charm (Suzuran Mamori)**: Tokyo Daijingu's signature item! This charm is shaped like a lily of the valley, a flower whose language means 'happiness will find you.' A small bell is hidden inside the pure white flower, making a clear, gentle sound when shaken.
- **Love Fulfillment Key Charm**: Shaped like a key to open your partner's heart.
- **Koi Mikuji (Love Fortune)**: A fortune slip is hidden inside a cute Japanese paper doll. Each doll has a different expression and kimono pattern, so you can pick your favorite one. They are very popular for offering specific and sometimes brutally honest (?) advice on love.
