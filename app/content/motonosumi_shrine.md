title: 'A Japanese Scenic View Praised by CNN: The Tunnel of 123 Red Torii Gates and
  the Legend of the White Fox, Motonosumi Shrine'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap', traveling the world to find hidden gem-like shrines.

Today, I want to guide you to the rugged coast of Yamaguchi Prefecture, at the western tip of Honshu, Japan. Imagine this: the dazzling blue waves of the Sea of Japan crash against sheer cliffs, and above them, a vivid vermilion path, writhing like a living dragon, stretches out towards the sea.

This is **Motonosumi Shrine (元乃隅神社)**, a place that proudly earned its spot on CNN's list of **'Japan's 31 Most Beautiful Places'**, becoming a bucket-list destination for travelers worldwide.

With a contrast of colors so intense it feels unreal, and a hidden legend of a mystical white fox, this is more than just a tourist spot. It's a powerful "power spot" where the energy of Mother Nature and the earnest prayers of humanity meet. Shall we take a pilgrimage with me through the tunnel of 123 torii gates to that sacred cliff's edge where the tales of gods reside?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: A Miraculous Revelation from a White Fox

When visiting a shrine, the first things to understand are its resident 'gods' (神) and the 'story' of how they came to be there. The origin story of Motonosumi Shrine is all the more mysterious and intriguing because it began not in ancient mythology, but from a divine revelation in a relatively recent dream.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The White Fox Who Grants Wishes】**

The main figure here is the **'Byakko' (白狐), or the White Fox deity**.
In Shinto, Japan's indigenous faith, foxes are known as messengers of 'Inari Okami', the god of grain and prosperity. However, the white fox of Motonosumi Shrine is enshrined not merely as a messenger, but as a powerful spiritual being who governs human fortunes.

This white fox deity is renowned for granting wishes across nearly every aspect of human life.

- **Success**: Business prosperity and bountiful fishing (big catches)
- **Safety**: Maritime safety on the rough seas and traffic safety
- **Love**: Fostering good relationships (良縁) and blessing with children (子授け)
- **Others**: Warding off evil for good fortune (開運厄除), academic achievement, etc.

There are endless mystical accounts from visitors who, after their visit, saw long-unresolved business problems solved or were blessed with a long-awaited child.

#### **【Origin and History: The Fisherman's Dream and the Vow of 123 Gates】**

The history of Motonosumi Shrine dates back to 1955 (Showa 30).
A fisherman from this area (Yuyatsuo), Hitoshi Okamura, began to have a mysterious white fox appear in his dreams every night. The fox stood by his bedside and delivered a revelation, scolding him:

> "I am the white fox who has protected this land since ancient times. The prosperity and peace you now enjoy are all thanks to my care, yet how can you neglect me without even a single shrine in my honor? Immediately, you must enshrine me respectfully upon this cliff. If you do, I shall bestow even greater blessings upon this land and upon you."

Waking from the dream, Mr. Okamura knew this was no ordinary dream. He immediately gathered the villagers and, working together, they built a small shrine on the cliff designated by the fox and began to offer rites. This was the beginning of Motonosumi Shrine. The shrine's name, **'Motonosumi'**, combines **'Moto' (元, origin)** and **'Sumi' (隅, corner)**, carrying the dual meaning of 'the place of origin where the spirit resides' and 'the western corner of Japan's mainland'.

After the shrine was built, as if by magic, the village was blessed with abundant catches and a decrease in accidents. People began donating torii (the pillar gates at the entrance of a shrine) one by one in gratitude. These donations continued steadily for 10 years from 1987, eventually forming a massive red tunnel of **123 gates**. The magnificent landscape we see today is a miraculous collaboration between divine revelation and human faith.

### 2. 🌊 Strolling the Grounds (Keidai): Walking the Winding Red Path of a Dragon

The grounds of Motonosumi Shrine are three-dimensional. From the lowest cliff closest to the sea to the highest hill, the scenery changes with every step, like watching a panoramic film.

#### **【The Tunnel of 123 Torii Gates: A Path into the Realm of the Gods】**

The shrine's highlight and symbol is the **tunnel of 123 red torii gates**. This path, stretching about 100 meters in total, resembles a red dragon ascending to the heavens against the backdrop of the blue sea.

The moment you step inside this tunnel, you're overcome by a strange feeling. Above, the dense red pillars block out the sky, while the strong sea breeze and sunlight pour in through the gaps between them. With each step, the worries of the secular world seem to wash away, and you feel yourself entering deeper into a sacred realm filled only with the sound of waves and the color red.
Passing through the tunnel is not just a simple act of moving. It's akin to a ritual of purification to cleanse impurities and make your wishes come true. As you observe the names of the donors engraved on each pillar, take a moment to feel the immense number of earnest prayers that built this path.

#### **【Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden): A Prayer Atop the Cliff】**

After passing through the torii tunnel and reaching the highest point, you will find the modest yet dignified main hall (Honden) and worship hall (Haiden). From here, if you turn around, you can take in a spectacular view of the red path you just walked, winding its way down towards the sea.

In front of the worship hall, take a moment to catch your breath and pay your respects to the deity.
Perform the **'Nirei-nihakushu-ichirei' (二礼二拍手一礼)**.
Bow deeply twice, clap your hands twice to call the deity, and then, with your hands together, make your deepest wish in your heart. Finally, bow once more. It is a special moment where a sense of solitude, as if standing alone in the wild, intersects with the reassuring feeling that the deity is watching over you.

#### **【Japan's Most Difficult Offering Box: Fortune Favors the Bold】**

Once the solemn worship is over, it's time for a fun challenge. Look up at the top of the large torii gate at the shrine entrance. You will see an **offering box (saisen-bako)** attached to the pillar, 6 meters above the ground.

This is the famous **'Japan's Most Difficult Offering Box'**.
Thanks to the legend that "if you successfully toss a coin into that high place, your wish will surely come true," the area under the torii is always bustling with people tossing coins. On windy days, coins often miss their mark, but when the cheerful 'clink!' of a coin landing in the box is heard, everyone around cheers and congratulates the person. It's okay even if you fail. The fun challenge itself is said to bring good energy. (Of course, you can try again with a fallen coin, or use the regular offering box placed nearby; the divine effect is said to be the same, so don't be too disappointed!)

#### **【Ryugu's Geyser (龍宮の潮吹き): The Breath of Mother Nature】**

Below the shrine's cliff lies another natural power spot. It is the **'Ryugu no Shiofuki'** or "Ryugu's Geyser".
On days with rough waves, when seawater rushes into a eroded cave on the cliff face, the compressed air forces the water to shoot up to 30 meters high. It's a magnificent spectacle, as if a dragon from the underwater Dragon Palace (Ryugu) is breathing fiercely towards the sky. On sunny days, a rainbow sometimes forms in the rising spray. In the face of nature's overwhelming power, we learn humility and gain new energy.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Commemorating Your Visit

If you wish to preserve the emotional impact of your visit in a physical form, don't miss out on the Goshuin (a seal stamp certifying your visit) and Omamori (amulets).

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin from Motonosumi Shrine is almost a work of art.
In addition to the standard calligraphy and red stamps, you can receive a special Goshuin featuring beautiful illustrations of the shrine's symbols: the **'123 red torii gates and the blue sea'** and the mystical **'white fox'**. Every time you open your Goshuin-cho (stamp book), the memories of Yamaguchi's wild sea breeze and the intense red of the torii gates will come flooding back.
(※ Goshuin can be obtained at the shrine office on the grounds, and designs may vary by season.)

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **White Fox Charm (白狐お守り)**: A charmingly designed amulet featuring the deity's messenger, the white fox. It is said to have the all-purpose power of granting any wish, making it a popular souvenir.
- **Torii Charm**: An amulet shaped like the 123 torii gates, symbolizing the opening of new paths to luck (kaiun) and success.
- **Success Prayer Charm**: There are also humorous yet meaningful charms to commemorate or pray for success at the 'difficult offering box'. They will be a great source of strength for those tackling difficult goals.

### 4. 🚗 Nearby Attractions: Yamaguchi's Hidden Gems and Cuisine

The city of Nagato, where Motonosumi Shrine is located, and its surroundings make for a perfect driving course. Here are some nearby spots that are too good to miss.

#### **1. Tsunoshima Bridge (角島大橋)**

- **Why we recommend it**: About a 30-minute drive from Motonosumi Shrine. This 1,780m long bridge crossing over emerald-green waters is a frequent filming location for Japanese car commercials. The sense of liberation you feel while driving across it is unparalleled. A photo taken from the observatory at the bridge's entrance will be something to brag about for a lifetime.

#### **2. Senjojiki (千畳敷)**

- **Why we recommend it**: A 15-minute drive from the shrine. This is a vast grassland spread across a 333m high plateau. As its name, which means '1,000 tatami mats', suggests, the horizon of the Sea of Japan stretches endlessly beyond the open meadow. A cup of coffee at the cafe here while gazing at the sea will wash away your travel fatigue.

#### **3. Cuisine: Translucent 'Live Squid (Ika)' and 'Kawara Soba'**

- **Recommended eateries**: Restaurants around Senzaki Port, such as 'Kiwara Meshi Kamon (か もん)'.
- **What to enjoy**: Nagato City is famous for 'Kensaki Ika' (swordtip squid), known as the king of squids. It's caught from a tank right after you order and served as sashimi, so fresh and translucent it still moves on the plate. The sweet flavor that deepens as you chew is a delicacy you must try. Also, don't miss 'Kawara Soba', a Yamaguchi specialty of green tea soba noodles and meat served on a sizzling hot roof tile.
