Hello to all you travel lovers! This is your 'JinjaMap' editor, here to introduce you to the hidden gems of shrines scattered across Japan.

Today, I will guide you to a special place nestled deep in the mountains of Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan. A land of overlapping mountains where even the clouds are said to rest, shrouded in a mystical fog: **Takachiho (高千穂)**. This is no ordinary tourist destination. It is a sacred ground where the legend of 'Tenson Korin' (天孫降臨), the beginning of Japanese mythology, is alive and breathing—a spiritual homeland where numerous gods are said to have descended to take their first steps on earth.

At the heart of this mythology, **Takachiho Shrine (高千穂神社)** has stood serenely for an impressive 1900 years. The phytoncides emanating from the lush cedar forest, the primeval silence, and the stories of the gods dwelling within. The moment you step into the shrine grounds, you'll feel as if you've traveled back in time to the age of myths.

From the sound of the wind flowing through the overwhelmingly majestic giant trees, to the mystical cedar said to grant wishes, and the nightly dance of the gods, 'Yokagura'. Takachiho Shrine offers an unforgettable experience for travelers who wish to explore the spiritual roots of Japan, and for those who dream of true healing and new relationships. Now, shall we journey together to Takachiho Shrine, where the breath of the gods resides?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Where 1900 Years of Myth Become History

When visiting a shrine, the first things to understand are its resident deities ('Saijin') and the stories they hold. The reason why Takachiho Shrine is considered one of Japan's most powerful spiritual spots can be found in the very lineup of the gods enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Protagonists of the Creation Myth】**

Takachiho Shrine doesn't just enshrine one deity, but a large assembly of key figures from Japan's founding mythology. They are broadly divided into the **'Takachiho Sumegami (高千穂皇神)'** and the **'Jissha Daimyojin (十社大明神)'**, and their roster is nothing short of breathtaking.

- **Takachiho Sumegami (高千穂皇神)**:
  This is the main deity of the shrine. It is led by the heavenly grandson **Ninigi-no-Mikoto (瓊瓊杵尊)**, grandson of the sun goddess 'Amaterasu Omikami,' who descended from the heavens to rule the earth. He is joined by his wife Konohanasakuya-hime, their son Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto and his wife, and their grandson Ugayafukiaezu-no-Mikoto and his wife. In other words, **the entire divine lineage spanning three generations leading up to the first Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇)** is enshrined here collectively.
  Not only do they govern agricultural abundance (Gokoku Hojo), but because the divine couples are enshrined together, they are known to have exceptional efficacy for **marital harmony (夫婦円満), matchmaking (縁結び), and prosperity of descendants (子孫繁栄)**.

- **Jissha Daimyojin (十社大明神)**:
  This refers to the ten deities, including the heroic god **Mikeiri-no-Mikoto (三毛入野命)**, who pioneered and protected the Takachiho region, along with his brothers, wife, and children. Mikeiri-no-Mikoto, in particular, was the older brother of the first Emperor Jimmu and a legendary figure who returned to the land of Takachiho to defeat a demon that tormented the region. Thanks to his valor, Takachiho Shrine is also renowned as a sacred site for **warding off evil (厄除け) and praying for victory in overcoming all obstacles (必勝祈願)**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Land of Tenson Korin】**

The recorded history of this place dates back about 1900 years to the reign of the 11th Emperor Suinin. However, its legendary timeline points to a far more ancient, primeval era.

According to Japan's oldest historical texts, the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki," Amaterasu Omikami bestowed the Three Sacred Treasures (a mirror, a sword, and a jewel) upon her grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto, commanding him, "Rule this land of bountiful reed plains (Japan)." The place where Ninigi-no-Mikoto led numerous gods through the clouds and first set foot is said to be the peak of 'Kushifuru-no-mine' in Takachiho.

Takachiho Shrine is the head shrine of the '88 Shrines of Takachiho,' established to protect this sacred site of descent and to enshrine the imperial ancestors. It has been venerated by the imperial court since ancient times, and its prestige was so great that powerful historical figures like Minamoto no Yoritomo sent envoys to worship here and donated buildings. This place is more than just a religious facility; it is a living history museum symbolizing the origins and identity of the nation of Japan.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Stories from the Forest and Power Spots

Now, let's take a proper walk through the grounds. As you pass through the torii gate at the entrance and step onto the main path, you can feel the air change. The shade cast by the giant cedar trees soaring towards the sky, the ethereal sunlight filtering through the leaves (komorebi), and the refreshing, sacred scent of the forest that brushes your nose. With every step, you feel the clutter in your mind being washed away.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden): Architectural Beauty with the Breath of Wood**

At the end of the path, the majestic Worship Hall (Haiden) appears, and behind it, the Main Hall (Honden), a nationally designated Important Cultural Property. The current Honden was rebuilt in 1778 during the Edo period and features a unique and grand architectural style known as **'Gokensha Nagare-zukuri (五間社流造)'**. Instead of vibrant colors, the building embraces the natural texture of the wood and the marks of time, which imparts an even deeper sense of sanctity.

There's a point here you absolutely must not miss!
It's the carving of **'Mikeiri-no-Mikoto's Demon Slaying'** on the eastern wall of the Honden.
According to legend, a violent demon named 'Kihachi' lived in Takachiho long ago, tormenting the people. Mikeiri-no-Mikoto tracked down this demon and defeated it after a fierce battle. The carving vividly depicts this dynamic moment. The valiant expression of Mikeiri-no-Mikoto with his sword raised and the submissive posture of Kihachi convey a powerful energy that wards off evil to all who see it.

#### **💕 Meoto Sugi (夫婦杉): The Miracle Trees that Grant Love**

Turn your gaze beside the Honden, and you'll see Takachiho Shrine's greatest attraction and power spot: the **'Meoto Sugi (Couple Cedar Trees)'**. Two massive cedar trees are firmly joined at their roots, appearing as if they are holding hands tightly.

A very romantic legend and blessing are associated with these trees.
**"If you walk around these trees three times while holding hands with a loved one, friend, or family member, your bond will strengthen, your descendants will prosper, and your household will find peace."**
Indeed, if you visit here, you will see many couples and families smiling shyly as they hold hands and circle the trees—a heartwarming sight. Came alone? Don't worry. It's said that circling the trees with a devout heart while praying for a future relationship is just as effective. Take in the energy of these trees, which have stood together for about 800 long years, and make a promise of eternal love with your cherished one.

#### **Chichibu Sugi (秩父杉) and Shizumeishi (鎮石)**

Besides the Meoto Sugi, there are other amazing sights hidden within the grounds.

- **Chichibu Sugi**: An overwhelmingly large cedar tree, 800 years old and 55 meters tall. It is said to have been personally planted by the Kamakura period warrior Hatakeyama Shigetada when he came to worship at Takachiho Shrine. Its magnificent form, so tall that you can't see the top even when you crane your neck, inspires a sense of awe for nature. It is designated as a Natural Monument of Miyazaki Prefecture.
- **Shizumeishi (Calming Stone)**: This stone, placed quietly near the Honden, is the 'stone that pacifies chaos.' It is believed to possess the power to calm human worries, worldly turmoil, and even disasters like earthquakes. When your mind is troubled or anxious, standing before this stone and offering a quiet prayer can bring a sense of peace and tranquility.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Etching the Memories of Your Trip

The perfect way to conclude a shrine visit is with a Goshuin (御朱印) and Omamori (amulets), isn't it? The授与所 (juyosho, or shrine office) at Takachiho Shrine is always bustling with visitors.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Takachiho Shrine is as powerful and elegant as its history.
The characters **'高千穂神社 (Takachiho Jinja)'** written in thick black ink in the center exude a sense of grandeur just from the calligraphy. The red shrine seal stamped over it, in an ancient script style, gives it the feel of a work of art. On the right, '奉拝' (Hohai, meaning 'worship'), and on the left, the date of your visit is written. This single sheet of paper will be the most certain proof that you have visited the land of myths.
_Tip: The original Goshuincho (Goshuin book) of Takachiho Shrine is adorned with unique motifs like Yokagura or the Meoto Sugi, making it highly collectible._

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Meoto Sugi Amulet**: As expected, the most popular items are the matchmaking amulets. Designed with the Couple Cedar Trees as a motif, this amulet is the perfect gift for those wishing for a crush to be reciprocated or for those who want to deepen their current relationship.
- **Warding Off Evil / Victory Amulet**: This amulet is imbued with the legend of Mikeiri-no-Mikoto's demon slaying. It provides powerful protection for those facing important exams, business ventures, competitions, or for those worried about unlucky years (sanzai, 三災).
- **Kagura Bell**: A small bell with a clear, pure sound. This sound is believed to drive away bad energy and purify the space around it.

### 4. 🗺️ Nearby Attractions & Cuisine: How to Enjoy Takachiho 200%

Takachiho has too much charm to leave after seeing only the shrine. Here are some nearby attractions and eateries to visit along with the shrine.

#### **1. Takachiho Gorge (高千穂峡)**

A must-see course located a 20-minute walk or a 5-minute drive from Takachiho Shrine. The sight of emerald-green water flowing between columnar joint cliffs formed by the volcanic activity of Mt. Aso is truly a masterpiece of nature. The experience of rowing a boat under the 17-meter-high **'Manai Falls' (真名井の滝)** will be an unforgettable memory. Feel like a celestial being as you row through the mystical water mist.

#### **2. Amano Iwato Shrine (天岩戸神社) & Amano Yasugawara**

Reachable in about 15 minutes by car from Takachiho Shrine. This is the shrine that enshrines 'Amano Iwato,' the legendary cave where the sun goddess Amaterasu hid. Deeper inside, you'll find 'Amano Yasugawara,' a cave with tens of thousands of stacked stone towers. This is the spot where eight million gods are said to have held a council meeting. The dreamlike and spiritual atmosphere created by the layers upon layers of stone towers is overwhelmingly beautiful, beyond what photos can capture.

#### **3. Cuisine: Melt-in-Your-Mouth 'Takachiho Beef' (高千穂牛)**

A trip isn't complete without delicious food. Takachiho is one of Japan's top producers of Wagyu beef. 'Takachiho beef' is famous for its beautiful marbling and rich flavor, and its taste is guaranteed—it won the Prime Minister's Award at the National Wagyu Competition in 2007.

- **Recommended Restaurant**: 'Takachiho Beef Restaurant Nagomi (和)' - Within walking distance from the shrine. You can enjoy steak or hamburg steak set meals at a relatively reasonable price for lunch. A single piece of tender, melting meat will wash away all your travel fatigue.
