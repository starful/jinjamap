Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find hidden sacred gems around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Asahikawa (旭川), a city full of winter romance in the kingdom of snow, Hokkaido. Here, watched over by the magnificent Daisetsuzan mountain range, lies **'Asahikawa Shrine (旭川神社)'**, a place imbued with the ardent wishes of pioneers who cultivated the forest with their bare hands 130 years ago.

Nestled within the lush woods of 'Kaguraoka Park,' which retains the energy of an ancient primeval forest, this shrine is more than just a religious facility; it is living proof of Hokkaido's pioneering history.
From the stories of the gods who gave courage to the pioneers, to a tranquil walk along a forest path, and even Asahikawa's famous ramen, a special journey that nourishes both body and soul begins now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Prayer that Turned Wasteland into Fertile Soil

The history of Asahikawa Shrine is a drama in itself.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of the Sun and Pioneering】**

This shrine venerates Japan's highest deity, **Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess)**, along with the **'Three Pioneer Deities (Okuninushi, Sukunahikona, etc.)'**.
Because the sun goddess who bestows light and the gods of pioneering who cultivate harsh lands are enshrined together, this place is believed to exert a powerful influence not only for **'new beginnings'**, **'business success'**, and **'family safety'**, but also for **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Blood and Sweat of the Tondenhei】**

In 1893, the 'Tondenhei' (military pioneers) who arrived in the uncharted land of Hokkaido had to battle temperatures of -30°C, wild animals, and loneliness. They needed a spiritual sanctuary and built a small shrine to honor the gods of their hometowns. This was the beginning of Asahikawa Shrine.
Later, in 1902, it was moved to its current location, 'Kaguraoka' (the Hill Where Gods Play), becoming the guardian deity of the region. The earnest prayers of that era are palpable throughout the shrine grounds.

### 2. 🌲 Strolling the Grounds: A Sacred Forest and a Historic Site

Though not far from the city center, the shrine grounds are as serene as a deep mountain forest. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Worship Hall (Haiden) and Forest Path**

Passing through the torii gate at the entrance, you'll find lush trees forming a tunnel. Walking while breathing in the fresh air calms the mind. The snow-covered worship hall in winter exudes an even more mystical and solemn atmosphere.

#### **Asahikawa Heison (Garrison Village) Memorial Museum**

This museum within the shrine grounds is a **must-see**. Farm tools, daily necessities, and photographs actually used by the Tondenhei are on display, allowing you to vividly feel the harsh realities of life during the pioneering era. It's a place that deepens the meaning of your shrine visit.

#### **Kaguraden (Kagura Hall) and Weddings**

The area around the beautiful wooden Kaguraden is a place with a strong **'aura of love.'** This is because traditional weddings are often held here. It is a wonderful path for couples or partners to walk together.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Embodying the Courage of Pioneers

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**
