title: 'The Red Heart of Kyoto''s Gion, Yasaka Shrine: The Guardian Deity Who Fended
  Off a 1300-Year-Old Plague and the Mystical Spring That Bestows Beauty'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' where we introduce mystical sacred sites from around the world.

In the thousand-year-old ancient capital of Kyoto, if one were to pick the most splendid and vibrant street, it would undoubtedly be 'Gion (祇園)'. After passing through the stone-walled alleys of Hanamikoji, reminiscent of "Memoirs of a Geisha," and reaching the eastern end of Shijo-dori (四条通), a massive, intensely vermilion gate looks down upon us, as if separating the secular world from the divine realm.

This is the heart and guardian of Kyoto, **Yasaka Shrine (八坂神社)**.

Affectionately known as **'Gion-san (祇園さん)'** by the locals, this place is more than just a tourist attraction. For over 1,300 years, it has been the center of a spiritual barrier protecting Kyoto from plagues and disasters, and it is the historic site where the Gion Matsuri, one of Japan's three major festivals, was born. It is also a place where a mystical spring said to grant beauty upon application and a powerful spot for forging romantic connections coexist.

Yasaka Shrine captivates travelers with its brilliant vermilion by day and its gentle lanterns by night. Today, let's open its red gates and embark on a pilgrimage deep into its sacred precincts, where myths and legends come alive.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Where Myth and History Intersect

Before marveling at the shrine's magnificent exterior, understanding the spirits enshrined within, the 'Saijin (祭神)', is the first step of a true pilgrimage. The master of Yasaka Shrine is a deity with one of the most dramatic stories in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The Hero and Guardian, Susanoo】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Susanoo-no-Mikoto (素戔嗚尊)**.
He is the younger brother of the sun goddess Amaterasu, a complex god possessing both a tempestuous nature and a heroic side. His most famous legend is the tale of vanquishing the 'Yamata no Orochi,' a monstrous eight-headed serpent, and presenting the divine sword (Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi) found in its tail to his sister. Thanks to this heroic narrative, he is revered as a powerful deity of **'Yakuyoke (厄除け)'—warding off all calamities and expelling evil spirits**.

Furthermore, enshrined at Yasaka Shrine are **Kushinadahime-no-Mikoto (櫛稲田姫命)**, whom Susanoo rescued and took as his wife, and their children, the **Yahashira-no-Mikogami (八柱御子神)**. Because the couple and their children are enshrined together, this place is said to have excellent efficacy in promoting **marital harmony**, **matchmaking (縁結び, en-musubi)**, and **prosperity of descendants**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Birthplace of the Gion Matsuri】**

There are two interesting theories about the origin of Yasaka Shrine.
One theory is that in 656, an envoy from Goguryeo, 'Iryeosi-omi,' brought a deity from Mt. Udu (牛頭山) in Silla and enshrined it here. This highlights the deep ancient ties between the Korean peninsula and Japan. The fact that this place was long called 'Gion-sha (祇園社)' and enshrined the Buddhist guardian deity 'Gozu Tenno' is not unrelated to this background.

Another theory is linked to a historical event that changed Kyoto's destiny. In 869, a terrible plague swept through Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and the rest of Japan. People at the time believed it was caused by the vengeful spirits of aristocrats who had died with grudges. To appease them, 66 halberds (hoko), symbolizing the 66 provinces of Japan at the time, were erected, and a ritual was held. This was the very beginning of the **'Gion Matsuri (祇園祭)'**, which is now a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage and a world-renowned festival.

In other words, Yasaka Shrine has been the spiritual anchor for the people of Kyoto, who have fought against the fear of epidemics and disasters for 1,300 years. Even now, every July, magnificent floats parade through the streets to pray for the eradication of plagues, continuing the shrine's ancient mission.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: A Power Spot Where Dragon Veins Flow

The precincts of Yasaka Shrine are vast and deep. Once you pass through the main gate bustling with tourists and venture a little further inside, you will encounter hidden gems suffused with sacred energy.

#### **Nishiromon (西楼門) and Maiden (舞殿)**

The two-story vermilion gate you encounter at the end of Shijo-dori, the **Nishiromon**, is the symbol of Yasaka Shrine and a landmark of eastern Kyoto. Although the official main gate is located to the south, this west gate, connected to the Gion district, serves as the de facto main entrance. After sunset, when the gate is illuminated, its vermilion color against the night sky creates a dreamlike atmosphere.

Passing through the gate, you will see the **Maiden (舞殿)**, a stage adorned with countless hanging lanterns. This is a space for offering dance and music to the gods and a venue for wedding ceremonies. Each lantern bears the name of a historic restaurant (料亭, ryotei) or shop in Gion, showing how much the local merchants cherish this shrine. At night, these lanterns are lit all at once, creating a fantastical night view.

#### **Honden (Main Hall): The Pond Where the Blue Dragon Dwells**

The massive **Honden** located behind the Maiden is a precious piece of architecture designated as a National Treasure. Its unique style, where the main hall (where the deity resides) and the worship hall (where people pray) are covered by a single large roof, is called **'Gion-zukuri (祇園造)'**. This rare form can only be seen at Yasaka Shrine in all of Japan.

There is a legend here that you should not miss. It is said that there is a deep pond beneath the Honden, and living there is the **'Blue Dragon (青龍, Seiryu)'**, one of the four guardian deities of Kyoto who governs the east. This pond is believed to be connected to a 'ryuketsu (龍穴)' or 'dragon hole,' from which the earth's energy springs forth. Praying in front of the Honden is said to allow you to receive the powerful energy of the Blue Dragon.

#### **Utsukushi Gozen-sha (美御前社): The Spring That Gifts Beauty**

For female travelers, this is an absolute must-visit spot. Located in the inner area to the right of the Honden is the **'Utsukushi Gozen-sha'**. As its name, which contains the character for 'beauty (美),' suggests, it enshrines three goddesses who govern beauty, arts, and wealth (the three Munakata goddesses).

In front of this small shrine, a sacred spring called **'Biyosui (美容水)'** or 'Beauty Water' gushes forth.
_"Applying two or three drops of this water to your skin not only improves your complexion but also purifies and beautifies your heart."_
Thanks to this legend, the geiko (geisha) and maiko of Kyoto are also said to frequent this place to offer their prayers. You cannot drink the water, but try taking a little in your hand, dabbing it on your face, and praying for both inner and outer beauty.

#### **Ekijinja (疫神社) and Okuninushi-sha (大国主社)**

- **Ekijinja**: Meaning 'Plague Shrine,' it enshrines a figure named Somin Shorai. Long ago, when Susanoo was traveling, he stayed overnight at the home of the poor Somin Shorai. As a reward, he promised, "If you wear a ring of cogon grass (chinowa) around your waist, I will protect you from plagues." This legend became the origin of the 'chimaki,' the good luck charm of the Gion Matsuri. It is the best place to pray for good health.
- **Okuninushi-sha**: This shrine is dedicated to Okuninushi, Susanoo's son-in-law and the god of relationships. As the hero of the 'White Hare of Inaba' myth, the shrine is filled with rabbit statues and heart-shaped ema (votive plaques). If you have a crush or are hoping for a good match, be sure to stop by here.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Offerings: Taking Home a Divine Blessing

Yasaka Shrine is full of unique souvenirs that carry its special stories.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin from Yasaka Shrine is famous for its powerful and beautiful calligraphy.

- **Gion-sha (祇園社) Goshuin**: The basic goshuin featuring the shrine's old name, stamped with the shrine's crest (shinmon), which resembles a slice of cucumber.
- **Seiryu (青龍) Goshuin**: A special goshuin imbued with the energy of the Blue Dragon said to live beneath the Honden. It features a blue dragon seal that feels powerful just to look at.
- **Limited Edition**: During the Gion Matsuri in July or at New Year's, you can receive special limited-edition goshuin.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Bimori (美守)**: An amulet that contains the blessings of Utsukushi Gozen-sha. Its beautiful design makes it a popular gift, and it is said to protect those who seek true beauty.
- **Chimaki (ちまき)**: The symbol of the Gion Matsuri. It is not an edible rice cake but a protective amulet made of woven cogon grass (chigaya). If you hang it at your entrance, it is believed to prevent plagues and disasters from entering your home for a year.
- **Sakura-suzu (桜鈴)**: A small bell shaped like a cherry blossom. The clear sound of the bell is believed to drive away bad energy and attract good relationships.

### 4. 🍵 Nearby Attractions: Soaking in the Gion Atmosphere

Since Yasaka Shrine is located in the heart of Gion, it is surrounded by an abundance of sights and culinary delights.

#### **1. Gion Hanamikoji (祇園花見小路)**

This street is directly connected across the road from the shrine's west gate (Nishiromon). It is a preserved district lined with traditional townhouses (machiya) with red latticework, the very image that comes to mind when you think of Kyoto. If you're lucky, you might even see a geiko or maiko heading to an engagement in the evening. It is the best place to experience the authentic old-world charm of Kyoto.

#### **2. Maruyama Park (円山公園)**

Naturally extending from the east side of the shrine, this is the oldest park in Kyoto. In spring, it becomes a famous cherry blossom viewing spot, especially known for its massive weeping cherry tree (shidarezakura) that blooms magnificently. It's the perfect place to take a short break at a teahouse within the park after visiting the shrine.

#### **3. Gourmet: Saryo Tsujiri Gion Main Store (茶寮都路里)**

You can't talk about Kyoto without mentioning matcha. A short walk down Shijo-dori from Yasaka Shrine, you'll find 'Tsujiri,' which always has a long line. The 'Special Tsujiri Parfait,' generously made with rich Uji matcha, is the ultimate dessert to recharge your tired legs and sugar levels after a day of worship.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

On the surface, Yasaka Shrine may seem like a flashy tourist destination, but if you look deeper, you'll find a warm comfort that has been soothing people's anxieties and fulfilling their prayers for 1,300 long years.

It is a place that offers prayers for healing when plagues strike, a thread of connection when love is needed, and a clear spring when one wishes for beauty. Walking through its precincts, I could feel why the people of Kyoto affectionately call this place 'Gion-san,' as if it were a member of their own family.

If you travel to Kyoto, why not visit Yasaka Shrine, where the vibrancy of the day and the tranquility of the night coexist, to receive the energy of the Blue Dragon and purify your heart with its beauty water?
