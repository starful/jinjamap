At the tip of the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture, a mysterious island floats alone on the blue waves of the Pacific Ocean: **Kinkasan (金華山)**. The entire island is considered a sacred domain of the gods and is home to a legendary shrine with deep ties to the first discovery of gold in Japanese history. It is a place where the powerful belief has been passed down that "if you visit for three consecutive years, you can live your entire life without money worries." This is **Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine (金華山黄金山神社)**.

This is more than just a simple visit; it's a wondrous pilgrimage that feels like stepping into a page of myth and history. Today, let's cross the sea together to this island of the gods and journey to the heart of this shrine, known as Japan's greatest power spot for financial luck.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

At the heart of Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine are two central deities: **Kanayamahiko-no-kami (金山毘古神)** and **Kanayamahime-no-kami (金山毘売神)**. In Japanese mythology, these two gods preside over mines and metals, possessing a powerful divine nature that resonates with the character for "gold (金)" in their very names. As they govern all aspects of mining, smelting, and processing metals, they have long been deeply revered by blacksmiths and miners. In modern times, they have become widely known as deities of commercial prosperity, asset building, and, above all, powerful **improvement in financial luck (金運円満)**.

Furthermore, the shrine also enshrines **Benzaiten (弁財天)**, one of the Seven Lucky Gods and the goddess of wealth, arts, and wisdom. This inspires a profound faith that no wish related to wealth will be ignored. The combination of these three deities is the key reason why Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine has established itself as one of Japan's leading shrines for financial fortune.

#### **【Origin and History】**

The story of this shrine's founding is intertwined with one of the most dramatic moments in ancient Japanese history. It dates back to the Nara period in 749, when Emperor Shōmu was overseeing the creation of the world's largest bronze Buddha statue, the Great Buddha of Nara (奈良の大仏), at Tōdai-ji temple in Nara.

Although the casting of the statue was a success, the emperor had one major concern. He wished to gild the massive statue to illuminate the world with the Buddha's compassionate light, but at the time, gold was not produced in Japan, making it seem impossible to acquire the vast amount needed. The emperor prayed fervently to the gods throughout the land: *"To uphold the dignity of the Buddha and to govern this nation by Buddhist law, I beseech you to grant us gold from this land."*

Just then, miraculous news reached the capital of Nara. A report arrived that placer gold (砂金) had been discovered for the first time in Japanese history in Oda district, Mutsu Province (陸奥国, modern-day Tohoku region), at the far eastern end of the country. This was more than a simple mineral discovery; it was seen as clear proof that the emperor's prayers had reached the gods and a blessing bestowed by them. Overjoyed, Emperor Shōmu changed the era name from 'Tenpyō (天平)' to **'Tenpyō-kanpō (天平感宝, Heaven-Sent Treasure)'**, and then again to **'Tenpyō-shōhō (天平勝宝, Heaven-Sent Treasure is Victorious)'**, announcing the joyous event throughout the nation.

To commemorate this historic first discovery of gold and to express gratitude to the gods, a shrine was established on the sacred island of Kinkasan, near the land where the gold was found. This was the beginning of Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine, where the gods of mining were enshrined. Just as its name suggests, 'the mountain where golden flowers bloom (金華山)', this place was the very sacred ground that heralded the golden dawn of Japan's prosperity.

Since then, the shrine has been under the devoted protection of powerful figures of the time, such as the Ōshū Fujiwara clan and the Date clan. In particular, Date Masamune, the lord of the Sendai Domain, showed deep faith by extensively repairing the shrine buildings and donating land.

As such, Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine is a place where the myth and history of a gold discovery that changed a nation's destiny are vividly alive. To set foot here is to have a special experience of feeling the energy of 'wealth (富)' and 'abundance (豊)' accumulated over nearly 1,300 years.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The entire island of Kinkasan is a sacred precinct (神域). From the moment you step off the ferry, you can feel a pure, sacred air, different from the secular world, enveloping you. As you walk along the forest path where deer, considered messengers of the gods (神使), roam freely, the grand figure of the shrine finally unfolds before your eyes.

#### **【Main Hall (本殿) & Hall of Worship (拝殿)】**

Climbing the steep stone steps, you are greeted by the dignified Haiden (拝殿, Hall of Worship). Although the current building was reconstructed during the Meiji era, the intricate and splendid carvings scattered throughout offer a glimpse into the aesthetic sense of the Date clan. The elaborate decorations on the roof and eaves, in particular, have long captivated visitors.

Here, you should offer your respects to the deities according to the prescribed etiquette of 'two bows, two claps, one bow (二拝二拍手一拝)'. Close your eyes, call the names of the two gods in your heart, and make your earnest wish. Behind the Haiden lies the Honden (本殿, Main Hall where the deities reside), which is off-limits to the general public, adding to its sanctity.

#### **【Symbolic Torii and Approach Path】**

Several torii (鳥居) gates stand along the path from the pier to the shrine. The first torii, set against the backdrop of the sea, is a symbolic gateway marking the beginning of the Kinkasan pilgrimage. The moment you see this torii from the boat, a sense of reverence for entering the gods' domain naturally arises.

On both sides of the approach, massive cedar trees that look to be hundreds of years old stretch towards the sky. Simply walking along this forest path can be a powerfully healing experience that purifies the mind. The stone lanterns (石灯籠) lining the path seem to tell the story of the deep faith that has protected the shrine for ages.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Zeniarai-ba (銭洗い場, Money-Washing Place)**: Like many shrines dedicated to wealth, Kinkasan has a Zeniarai-ba. There is a belief that if you wash your coins or bills in the sacred water flowing from the mouth of a dragon, the money will multiply and return to you. Place your money in one of the provided baskets and wash it with care as you pray for increased financial fortune. It is said to be best not to spend the washed money immediately but to keep it in your wallet as 'seed money (種銭)'.
- **Benzaiten-gū (弁財天宮) and Ryūjin (龍神, Dragon God)**: In a corner of the precincts, there is a small shrine dedicated to Benzaiten. As a goddess of water, Benzaiten is deeply connected to dragons, and it is said that a particularly strong energy of the dragon god can be felt in this area. It is a must-visit spot for those praying for business prosperity or the blossoming of artistic talent.
- **Okunomiya (奥の宮) at the Summit**: If time and energy permit, a climb to the Okunomiya (奥の宮, inner shrine) at the 445-meter summit of Mt. Kinka is highly recommended. It is about a 90-minute hike. As you ascend the sacred path through a dense primeval forest, you can feel the worries of the world fade away. At the summit, a panoramic view of the vast Pacific Ocean unfolds, creating a magnificent sense of becoming one with the sky, the sea, and yourself. Prayers offered here are said to reach the gods more directly.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Proof of Your Visit

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

Befitting its fame, the Goshuin of Kinkasan Koganeyama Shrine is renowned for its powerful and elegant calligraphy. The name of the shrine, '黄金山神社', is written boldly and clearly in the center, with the phrase '奉拝' (hōhai, respectfully worship) on the right and the date of your visit on the left. It is completed with the red seal (朱印) bearing the shrine's name.

In addition to the standard Goshuin, the shrine sometimes offers special Goshuin written on golden paper or limited-edition ones available only on New Year's or specific festival days. Check the official website for information before your visit. This Goshuin is more than a souvenir; it is a precious symbol of your connection with the gods.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物) - Amulets & Lucky Charms】**

As one of Japan's top shrines for financial luck, it offers many unique and potent charms and souvenirs related to wealth.

- **Kabu-mamori (かぶ守り, Turnip Charm)**: This is the shrine's most unique and popular charm. 'Kabu (かぶ)' means turnip, but it has the same pronunciation as 'kabu (株),' which means stocks. Thus, it carries the meaning of 'stocks will rise (株が上がる)'. It is considered the perfect gift for stock investors or business owners. The cute turnip-shaped design is also appealing.
- **Ichiryū Manbai Omamori (一粒万倍御守, One Grain, Ten-Thousand-Fold Amulet)**: This amulet embodies the meaning of 'Ichiryū Manbai (一粒万倍)', which means 'a single grain of rice grows to produce ten thousand grains'. It signifies that small efforts lead to great rewards, providing powerful support for those starting new financial endeavors such as a business, an investment, or a savings plan.
- **Gold Panning Kit (砂金採りセット)**: An interesting souvenir related to the shrine's origins. It contains actual gold dust in a small bottle, allowing you to take the golden energy of the shrine home with you. Just placing it on your desk feels like it could boost your financial luck.
