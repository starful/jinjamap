title: 'Futarasan Shrine, The True Heart of Nikko: 1200 Years of Myth and Golden Bonds
  of Love'
---

Hello, this is the editor from **'JinjaMap,'** where we introduce you to hidden sacred gems around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Nikko in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. There is a saying, "Don't say 'magnificent' until you've seen Nikko," a testament to its stunning scenery. Most travelers will first think of the brilliantly gilded 'Nikko Toshogu Shrine (東照宮).' But did you know that behind that splendor lies the **true heart** of Nikko's grand nature and faith?

This is **Futarasan Shrine (二荒山神社)**, the origin of Nikko's mountain worship and the guardian of this land for over 1,200 years.

This is more than just a tourist spot. It is the entrance to the realm of the gods, crossed via a legendary serpent bridge; a powerful 'sacred place for relationships' that forges bonds between couples and families; and a power spot where a mystical spring that rejuvenates the body flows. It's easy to overlook in the shadow of Toshogu's grandeur, but you cannot say you have truly experienced Nikko without meeting its spiritual source.

Now, shall we embark on a pilgrimage with me along the mystical forest path to Futarasan Shrine, where myths and history come alive?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Divine Family, the Source of Nikko

Futarasan Shrine deifies the magnificent nature of Nikko itself. What makes this place unique is that it enshrines a 'family of gods,' which is precisely why Futarasan Shrine is known as the ultimate power spot for **matchmaking (縁結び)**.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Family Gods of Love and Harmony】**

Futarasan Shrine deifies and enshrines the three representative mountains of Nikko (the Nikko Sanzan).

- **Father God (Husband): Onamuchi-no-Mikoto (大己貴命)**
  - His divine body is the majestic **Mt. Nantai (男体山)**, which rises behind the shrine. This deity, also identified with the nation-building god Okuninushi-no-Mikoto in Japanese mythology, is revered as a **Fuku-no-kami (福の神)**, a god of great fortune, and the supreme deity for forging romantic connections. Business prosperity and financial luck are added bonuses.
- **Mother Goddess (Wife): Tagorihime-no-Mikoto (田心姫命)**
  - She is a beautiful goddess whose divine body is **Mt. Nyoho (女峰山)**. She governs domestic harmony and safe childbirth, protecting the love of married couples alongside her husband.
- **Son God: Ajisukitakahikone-no-Mikoto (味耜高彦根命)**
  - A valiant son god whose divine body is **Mt. Taro (太郎山)**. He rules over agriculture and lightning, symbolizing the prosperity of descendants.

With the father, mother, and son gods all enshrined together, it is believed that praying here brings blessings to all human relationships forged through 'love,' from finding romance to marital bliss and the healthy growth of children.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of the Serpent Bridge and the Birth of Nikko】**

The history of Futarasan Shrine is the history of Nikko itself. Let's turn the clock back 1,200 years to the Nara period.

In 766, a young monk named **Shodo Shonin (勝道上人)** was drawn to the sacred mountains of Nikko. However, his path was blocked by the fiercely roaring rapids of the Daiya River (大谷川). As he stood before a river that seemed impossible for any human to cross, he prayed earnestly.

Then, a miracle occurred. From the opposite bank, a giant in the form of a god, 'Jinja-Daio,' appeared and threw a red and a blue snake, which he had coiled around his arm, into the river. The two snakes intertwined, forming a beautiful bridge like a rainbow, and mountain hydrangeas bloomed on their backs. Shodo Shonin was able to cross this mystical 'serpent bridge' and enter the Nikko mountains. This is the legend of the **Shinkyo Bridge (神橋)**, which is today a symbol of Nikko and a UNESCO World Heritage site.

After entering the mountains, Shodo Shonin built a shrine on the summit of Mt. Nantai in 782 to worship the mountain god, marking the beginning of Futarasan Shrine. He named this place 'Futarasan (二荒山),' inspired by 'Potalaka (補陀洛山),' the mythical paradise where the bodhisattva Kannon resides. An interesting fact is that 'Futarasan (二荒)' can be read as 'Niko' in Japanese, which later became the origin of the place name 'Nikko (日光).' In other words, this is the true source of the 'City of Light,' Nikko.

Later, the shrine was revered by the samurai of the Kamakura Shogunate, and during the Edo period, it was developed into its current form when Toshogu Shrine, which enshrines Tokugawa Ieyasu, was built nearby. However, long before the magnificent Toshogu was established, it was Futarasan Shrine that ruled the spirit of Nikko.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Forest of Myths and Power Spots

The precincts of Futarasan Shrine are more than just a path for worship. Within its vast sacred grounds (神域) spanning 3,400 hectares, powerful spots brimming with life force are hidden.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden): The Dignity of Momoyama Architecture**

Following the path from beside Toshogu Shrine, a large bronze torii gate appears. The **Worship Hall (Haiden)** visible beyond it was a building donated in 1619 by the second shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada. Unlike the opulence of Toshogu, it is a masterpiece of Momoyama period architecture that showcases the profound texture of unlacquered wood.

The **Main Hall (Honden)** behind the Haiden is a National Important Cultural Property. While general worshipers cannot get close, you can convey your prayers from the front of the Haiden using the "two bows, two claps, and one bow" etiquette. You will feel a sense of peace as if the tranquil forest air is listening to your prayers.

#### **Iconic Structure: Shinkyo Bridge (神橋), Crossing the Serpent Bridge**

A short distance from the main shrine, at the entrance to the Daiya River, stands the beautiful vermilion **Shinkyo Bridge**. This is the site of Shodo Shonin's 'serpent bridge legend' mentioned earlier and is considered one of Japan's three finest bridges.
In the past, it was a sacred domain that only priests or the shogun could cross, but now anyone can cross it for an admission fee. The view of the blue stream in the valley and the surrounding greenery from the bridge is truly spectacular. It's also a perfect spot for a commemorative photo to mark the start of your Nikko journey.

#### **4 Hidden Power Spots You Can't Miss**

1. **Couple Cedar (Meoto-sugi) & Parent-Child Cedar (Oyako-sugi)**
    Next to the main hall, there is a 'Couple Cedar,' where two cedar trees are joined as one from the roots, and a 'Parent-Child Cedar,' where three trees stand side by side. Befitting a shrine that enshrines family gods, it is said that praying before these trees will improve marital harmony and bring peace to the family. Feel the warm energy of the thousand-year-old trees.

2. **Futarasan Reizen (二荒山霊泉): The Fountain of Youth**
    In a corner of the precincts, there is a small spring where clear water gushes out. Known as the 'Spring of Wisdom' and the 'Spring of Rejuvenation (若返りの泉),' its water is sacred (霊水), containing the spiritual energy of the Nikko mountains. Legend has it that it cures eye ailments and makes one younger upon drinking, so many people come to collect the water. Taking a break at the teahouse next to the spring and sipping coffee or matcha made with this water will create an unforgettable memory.

3. **Sacred Tree of Matchmaking (Enmusubi-no-Goshiboku)**
    This is a fascinating tree where a cedar (sugi) has taken root and grown inside an oak (nara). It's connected to the Japanese pun "suki nara" (好きなら), meaning "if you like someone." Thus, the tree has become a messenger of love, with the saying, "If there is someone you like, pray to this tree." This is a must-visit spot for anyone with a crush.

4. **The Stroking Daikoku-sama (なで大黒様)**
    This is a wooden statue of Daikokuten, the god of fortune. As its name, which means "stroke and make a wish," suggests, gently rubbing the statue while praying is said to increase your financial luck and wealth. The belly of Daikoku-sama, worn smooth by the touch of countless hands, attests to its popularity.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Taking Home Love and Good Fortune

The perfect way to conclude a shrine pilgrimage is with goshuin and omamori. The talismans at Futarasan Shrine are especially charming and often related to 'relationships.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here are as dignified as the shrine's history.

- **Main Shrine Goshuin**: A harmonious design featuring the powerful calligraphy of '二荒山神社' and a vivid vermilion seal.
- **Shinkyo Bridge Goshuin**: Available at the entrance of the Shinkyo Bridge, this version includes a beautiful illustration of the bridge, making it highly collectible.
- **Seasonal Limited Editions**: Don't miss the limited-edition goshuin that change with the seasons, featuring cherry blossoms in spring or autumn leaves in fall.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Enmusubi Omamori**: These matchmaking charms, with their heart shapes and traditional knot designs, are so pretty they are also popular as gifts.
- **Usagi-mamori (Rabbit Charm)**: This charm was created because the main deity helped a white rabbit in a famous myth. Rabbits symbolize fertility and prosperity, making this charm a prayer for good relationships and thriving descendants.
- **Masaru (まさる) Charm**: This charm features a monkey (saru) and plays on words. "Saru" sounds like the phrase "ma ga saru," meaning "evil departs," and "masaru" means "to win." It is recommended for those who wish to ward off bad luck and seize victory.

### 4. 🍜 Nearby Attractions: The Flavors and Sights of Nikko

Nikko has too much charm to see only Futarasan Shrine. Be sure to enjoy the nearby famous spots and restaurants as well.

1. **Nikko Toshogu Shrine (日光東照宮)**
    - **3-minute walk away**: The pinnacle of opulence! Look for the Yomeimon Gate (陽明門), decorated with over 5,000 carvings, and the famous 'Three Wise Monkeys' and 'Sleeping Cat.' It's interesting to compare the simple dignity of Futarasan Shrine with the ornate splendor of Toshogu.

2. **Taiyuinbyo (大猷院廟)**
    - **5-minute walk away**: This is the mausoleum of the third shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu. Following his final wish "to serve my grandfather even in death," it is less extravagant than Toshogu, but its sophisticated architectural beauty, blending black and gold, is superb.

3. **Recommended Eatery: Yuba Cuisine Specialist 'Aburagen (あぶらげん)'**
    - Nikko's specialty is undoubtedly **'Yuba' (tofu skin)**. Try a yuba set meal at 'Aburagen' or 'Asaya Rest House' near the Shinkyo Bridge. The soft texture of fresh yuba and its various transformations—fried, simmered, and more—offer a healthy yet deeply flavorful experience. It's the perfect meal to soothe your stomach after a shrine visit.
