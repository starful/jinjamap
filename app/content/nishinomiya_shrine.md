Have you ever seen the news coverage of thousands of men sprinting at dawn on January 10th to become the 'Fukuotoko (福男, Lucky Man)'? This is the very stage for that fiery event. But behind this vibrant festival lies a moving myth of a deity born without bones and cast into the sea, who nevertheless overcame his fate to bring prosperity to the people.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: The Bringer of Fortune from the Sea, Ebisu-sama

Before passing through the red gate of Nishinomiya Shrine, let's first hear the dramatic story of its master, Ebisu-sama.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ebisu-no-Okami】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Ebisu-no-Okami (Hiruko-no-Mikoto)**.
Yes, that's him—the one with a fishing rod in his right hand, a large sea bream in his left, and a broad, beaming smile. Originally a god of fishing prayed to by fishermen for a bountiful catch, he came to be revered as the **'God of Commerce'** and **'God of Wealth'** as trade and markets developed over time. Today, he is the guardian deity not only for business owners and merchants but for everyone who wishes for happiness and prosperity.

#### **【Origins and History: The Grand Return of an Abandoned God】**

The birth myth of Ebisu-sama is a little sad, yet hopeful. According to the Japanese creation myth, **Hiruko**, the first child of the deities Izanagi and Izanami, was born with a disability—he had no bones. As a result, he was placed in a reed boat and cast adrift at sea.
However, he did not perish. He washed ashore here, off the coast of Nishinomiya (Wadanomisaki). The local fishermen enshrined him with great care, and in return, he became **'Ebisu,'** a god who brought fortune from across the sea, repaying the people for their kindness.

The story of Ebisu-sama, who overcame adversity to be reborn as the 'God of Fortune,' delivers a powerful and positive message to us all: "No matter the hardship, if you overcome it, good fortune will surely follow."

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Red Gate and Unique Architecture that Beckon Fortune

Nishinomiya Shrine is a place where you can feel invigorated just by walking through its grounds. Here are the must-see spots.

#### **Akamon (Red Gate) and the Stone-Paved Path**

The main gate of the shrine, the **'Omotedaimon (Akamon),'** is a National Important Cultural Property. It is said to have been donated by Hideyori, the son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and it is the very gate where the 'Fukuotoko Erabi (Lucky Man Race)' begins at 6 AM on January 10th. The 230-meter path leading from the gate to the main hall is usually tranquil, but during the festival, it brims with the passionate energy of countless people.

#### **National Treasure Main Hall: The One-and-Only Ebisu-zukuri**

The main hall (Honden), located behind the worship hall (Haiden), is built in a unique architectural style known as **'Ebisu-zukuri (Ebisu style),'** the only one of its kind in Japan. Its magnificent structure, featuring three roofs connected in a row, is so historically valuable that it has been designated a National Treasure.

#### **Araebisu Shrine: The Aura of a Competitor**

In the southern part of the precincts, you will find the **'Araebisu Shrine,'** which enshrines the rough spirit (aramitama) of Ebisu-sama. Unlike the gentle Ebisu-sama, the deity here is said to provide a powerful drive when starting new ventures or facing a challenge. Those launching a business or facing an important contract should definitely pay a visit here.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Essential Items for Business Prosperity

As the head shrine of Ebisu, it is filled with amulets related to 'fortune.' Just looking at them will make you feel as if you've become wealthy.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Nishinomiya Shrine features powerful calligraphy along with a red seal in the shape of a **'tai (sea bream).'** The sea bream is considered the ultimate symbol of good luck in Japan because 'tai' sounds similar to 'medetai,' which means auspicious or celebratory. During the 'Toka Ebisu' festival in January, you can also receive a limited-edition golden goshuin.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono】**

- **Fukuzasa (Lucky Bamboo)**: The most popular item, available only during the January festival. It consists of a bamboo branch adorned with various lucky charms like sea bream, old coins, and rice bales. Hanging it in your shop or home is said to bring in money all year round.
- **Taimikuji (Sea Bream Fortune)**: A fun way to get your fortune by "fishing" for a cute sea bream figurine with a small fishing rod. The **red sea bream** foretells 'peace for the year,' while the **gold sea bream** predicts 'financial luck.' Try to catch both fun and fortune at the same time.
- **Business Prosperity Wooden Plaque**: A sturdy wooden charm perfect for placing on a shop counter or in an office.
