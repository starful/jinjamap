Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap', traveling to sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to the pinnacle of Japanese Shinto, **'Ise Jingu (伊勢神宮)'**. It's a place the Japanese wish to visit at least once in their lifetime and the one and only sacred site that is known simply by the name 'Jingu' (The Grand Shrine).
From the vast cedar forest that has stood unchanged for over 2,000 years to the mystical ritual of 'Shikinen Sengu,' where the shrine is rebuilt every 20 years.
Shall we embark on a journey through time to Ise Jingu, a trip that goes beyond mere sightseeing to heal the soul?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Goddesses of the Sun and Abundance

Ise Jingu is broadly divided into the Naiku (Inner Shrine) and Geku (Outer Shrine). It is customary to visit both.

#### **【Naiku (内宮): Amaterasu-Omikami】**

The master of the Naiku is the supreme deity of Japanese mythology, **Amaterasu-Omikami (the Sun Goddess)**. She is the ancestral deity of the Imperial Family and a being like the light that illuminates the entire world.
Its origin dates back 2,000 years when Yamatohime-no-mikoto received a divine oracle and established the site on the banks of the Isuzu River. This place is the spiritual pillar of Japan and a symbol of peace.

#### **【Geku (外宮): Toyouke-no-Omikami】**

The master of the Geku is **Toyouke-no-Omikami (the God of Abundance)**. She presides over food, clothing, shelter, and industry, and is said to have been enshrined here to oversee the meals for Amaterasu.
Therefore, the principle order of worship is **'Geku first, then Naiku'**. (Perhaps it's polite to greet the deity who prepares the meals first?)

#### **【Shikinen Sengu (式年遷宮): Eternal Youth】**

The most distinct feature of Ise Jingu is the **'Shikinen Sengu,'** a ritual where an identical shrine building is constructed on an adjacent plot every 20 years, and the deity is transferred. This ceremony, which has been repeated 62 times over 1,300 years, embodies the idea of 'Tokowaka (常若),' which means passing down techniques and keeping the power of the deity eternally young.

### 2. 🌲 A Walk Through the Precincts: Sacred Forest and Clear River

Visiting Ise Jingu is a healing process in itself, just by walking.

#### **A Stroll Through Geku: A Serene Beginning**

Geku, located near Iseshi Station, is calm and solemn. After crossing the 'Hiyokebashi' bridge at the entrance, giant trees welcome you. The **'Goshoden (Main Sanctuary)'** can only be seen from behind a fence, but the sanctity felt beyond it is overwhelming. It is recommended to make personal wishes at the auxiliary shrine, **'Takanomiya'**.

#### **A Stroll Through Naiku: Purification of the Soul**

After taking a bus to Naiku, the **'Ujibashi'** bridge appears, connecting the secular world with the sacred precinct. Clear your mind as you cross this 100-meter-long wooden bridge.
Once across the bridge, you'll find the **'Isuzugawa Mitarashiba'**. This is a place to purify your body and mind by washing your hands in the clear river water. Dipping your hands in the cool water feels as if it clears your head.
Offering a reverent prayer at the bottom of the stairs to the innermost **'Goshoden'** completes the highlight of the pilgrimage.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: The Aesthetics of Simplicity

The items offered at Ise Jingu are not ornate, but they resonate deeply.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Ise Jingu has no stamp. Only the date and the characters **'皇大神宮 (Naiku)'** and **'豊受大神宮 (Geku)'** are written. This simplicity, as if to say "The authority of the Grand Shrine needs no adornment," conveys an even greater sense of dignity.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Suzumamori (Bell Charm)**: The clear sound of the bell is said to bring good fortune.
- **Kaiun Suzu (Good Luck Bell Charm)**: Its design, modeled after the Ujibashi bridge, is impressive.
- **Jingu Taima (Ofuda)**: This is the most fundamental talisman enshrined in the household altars (kamidana) of Japanese homes.

### 4. 🍡 Nearby Attractions: A Delicious Time-Travel to the Edo Period

After your visit, enjoy a food tour at **'Okage Yokocho'** and **'Oharai Machi'**!

#### **1. Akafuku Main Store (赤福)**

- **Must-Eat**: Ise's signature, **'Akafukumochi'**. The unique shape, with sweet red bean paste covering a rice cake, symbolizes the ripples of the Isuzu River. The taste of the mochi and tea, enjoyed while sitting on the veranda of the main store overlooking the river, is unforgettable.

#### **2. Ise Udon**

- **Features**: Thick, plump noodles are mixed with a dark, rich soy-based sauce. Despite its appearance, it's not salty and has a wonderfully soft texture. Try it at a long-established shop like **'Fukusuke'**.

#### **3. Tekonezushi (Bonito Rice Bowl)**

- **Features**: A fisherman's dish made by placing soy-marinated bonito sashimi over rice. It's an explosion of umami flavor.

#### **4. Meoto Iwa (Wedded Rocks)**

- **Location**: Futami Okitama Shrine (15 minutes by train).
- **Features**: Two rocks standing side by side in the sea, connected by a sacred rope (shimenawa). They symbolize marital harmony and connection.
