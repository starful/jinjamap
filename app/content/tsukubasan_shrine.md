title: 'The Land of Japanese Creation Myths Where Love and Destiny Begin: A Complete
  Guide to Ibaraki''s Tsukubasan Shrine'
---

Hello, dear readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Leaving the concrete jungle of Tokyo and driving across the open horizons of the Kanto Plain, a single, mysterious mountain rising majestically in the middle of the plain catches your eye. Bathed in the morning and evening sun, its surface takes on a purplish hue, earning it the beautiful nickname 'Shiho' (紫峰, the Purple Peak). This is **Mt. Tsukuba (筑波山)**.

The place I'm introducing today is an ancient sacred site that worships Mt. Tsukuba itself as its deity (御神体, goshintai): **Tsukubasan Shrine (筑波山神社)**. This is more than just a place to make wishes; it's where the creation myths of Japan lie sleeping. It is also a spiritual power spot that has long been compared to Mt. Fuji, as the saying goes, 'Fuji in the west, Tsukuba in the east'.

From the powerful life force emanating from the entire mountain and the rocks steeped in the legend of a devoted divine couple, to the amusing tale of a toad that brings financial fortune. Let's begin our pilgrimage to Tsukubasan Shrine, a place that has been waiting for us for over 3,000 years.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Place Imbued with Primordial Love

When visiting a shrine, the first thing to understand is its resident deities and the stories they hold. Tsukubasan Shrine is home to major deities who adorn the very first pages of Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Japan's First Divine Couple】**

The most distinct feature of Tsukubasan Shrine is that the entire mountain is considered the domain of the gods. In particular, the two peaks each enshrine one half of the divine couple who created the Japanese archipelago.

- **Mt. Nantai (男体山, West Peak) Summit**: Enshrines the husband deity, **Izanagi-no-Mikoto (伊弉諾尊)**. As the father of heaven, he symbolizes strength and creative energy.
- **Mt. Nyotai (女体山, East Peak) Summit**: Enshrines the wife deity, **Izanami-no-Mikoto (伊弉冉尊)**. As the mother of earth, she symbolizes acceptance and life force.

In Japanese mythology, these two deities stood on the heavenly floating bridge, churned the sea with a spear to create the Japanese islands, and gave birth to countless gods. They are the original divine couple. For this reason, Tsukubasan Shrine boasts some of the most powerful blessings in Japan for **matchmaking (縁結び, enmusubi)** and **marital harmony (夫婦和合, fufu-wago)**. This is why it draws an endless stream of visitors, from singles seeking a partner to couples wishing for a harmonious marriage. Furthermore, thanks to the myth of them having many children, it is also famous as a sacred place for **prosperity of descendants** and **safe childbirth**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Divergent Fates of Mt. Fuji and Mt. Tsukuba】**

The history of Tsukubasan Shrine is said to have begun around 3,000 years ago, predating written records. There is a fascinating legend about it recorded in the *Man'yoshu* (万葉集), Japan's oldest anthology of poetry. Knowing this story helps to understand why Mt. Tsukuba became such a beloved mountain.

Long ago, an ancestral god was traveling on a pilgrimage to various mountains. As dusk fell, he sought a place to stay for the night. The god first approached the magnificent and beautiful Mt. Fuji.
"May I rest here for the night?"
But arrogant Mt. Fuji coldly refused.
"I am a sacred mountain currently undergoing purification. I cannot allow outsiders in, so please leave."

Disappointed, the god turned and made his way to Mt. Tsukuba. Although not as tall as Mt. Fuji, Mt. Tsukuba welcomed the god warmly.
"Tonight we are celebrating the new harvest with a feast. Our accommodations may be humble, but please, come in, share our food, and rest."

Greatly moved by this hospitality, the god left a prophecy that would decide the fates of the two mountains.
"Because of its arrogance, Mt. Fuji will be covered in snow and ice year-round, becoming a cold and lonely mountain that people dare not climb. Mt. Tsukuba, on the other hand, which treated me with such warmth, will be a prosperous and joyous mountain where people gather in all seasons to sing, dance, eat, and drink, and it shall be loved forever."

Just as the legend foretells, Mt. Tsukuba became a friendly and prosperous mountain, attracting a constant stream of visitors, while Mt. Fuji became an object of awe but also a formidable peak. Tsukubasan Shrine embodies this spirit of acceptance and hospitality, warmly embracing all who visit like a mother's arms.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Pilgrimage Path from Earth to Sky

The grounds of Tsukubasan Shrine are vast and three-dimensional, stretching from the foot of the mountain to its summit. By making good use of the cable car and ropeway, even novice hikers can reach the summit, the realm of the gods.

#### **【Haiden (Hall of Worship) and Zuishinmon Gate: Feel the Breath of History】**

As you walk from the parking lot towards the shrine, a path lined with giant, sky-piercing cedar trees (suginamiki) welcomes pilgrims. The solemn atmosphere created by these centuries-old trees instantly purifies the mind of worldly thoughts.

The first thing that catches your eye is the overwhelmingly large **Zuishinmon Gate (随神門)**. It was originally built as a temple gate (Nio-mon) during the Edo period, but was converted into a shrine gate after the policy of separating Shinto and Buddhism in the Meiji era. It boasts a unique architectural beauty, combining the grandeur of Buddhist style with the simplicity of Shinto.

Passing through the gate, you will see the **Haiden (拝殿, Hall of Worship)** in front of you. Located midway up Mt. Tsukuba at an altitude of 270 meters, this is the main space where visitors offer their prayers. The ornate carvings and decorations, built with the support of the Edo shogunate, are remarkable. Ringing the giant bell (O-suzu) hanging in front of the Haiden produces a clear, deep sound that resonates with the soul.

- **Check Point**: Right next to the Haiden is a small bridge called **'Miyuki-bashi' (御幸橋)**. It is said that an emperor once crossed this bridge, and the sound of the mountain stream heard from here brings a sense of peace.

#### **【Summit Honden (Main Shrine): The Sanctuary Touching the Sky】**

To feel the true power of Tsukubasan Shrine, you must head to the summit.
From 'Miyawaki Station' next to the Haiden, an 8-minute cable car ride will take you to the summit area (Miyukigahara). A short walk from there leads you to the Honden (main shrines) on the two peaks.

- **Mt. Nantai Honden**: This is the sanctuary of the husband deity, built atop rugged rocks. The view from here makes you feel as if you have the whole world at your feet.
- **Mt. Nyotai Honden**: This is the sanctuary of the wife deity, situated at the end of a gentle ridge. You can access this side directly using the **ropeway**. It has a mystical atmosphere, earning it the name 'Uki-hashi of the Heavens' (Floating Bridge of the Heavens).

Visiting both Honden is called **'Ryogu-mairi' (両宮参り)**. It is believed that by doing so, you can receive the full blessing of the divine couple, maximizing your luck in relationships.

#### **【Power Spots: Miraculous Rocks that Grant Wishes】**

Near the summit, especially on the Mt. Nyotai side, you'll find an abundance of mystical rocks shaped by nature.

1. **Gama-ishi (ガマ石, Toad Rock)**
    This rock resembles a toad with its mouth wide open. Legend has it that the spirit of a miraculous toad, which produced 'Gama no Abura' (toad oil), resides here.
    - **How to make a wish**: It's said that if you toss a small pebble and it lands in the toad's mouth, your **financial luck** will soar. In Japanese, 'toad' (kaeru) is a homophone for 'to return' (kaeru), implying that 'money spent will return.' Give it a try for fun—it's harder than it looks!

2. **Meoto-iwa (夫婦岩, Couple Rocks)**
    These are two giant rocks leaning against each other. They resemble the divine couple Izanagi and Izanami standing affectionately together. Passing between them or offering a prayer here is said to be highly effective for **marital harmony** and **success in love**.

3. **Sazare-ishi (さざれ石)**
    In front of the Shidoden hall, next to the Haiden, you can find a 'Sazare-ishi,' a type of rock mentioned in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem, 'Kimigayo.' It is a conglomerate of small pebbles that have bonded together over eons to form a large boulder, symbolizing **eternal prosperity** and **unity**.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Taking Home the Divine Blessings

It's time to preserve the moving experience of your visit in a physical form. The items available at Tsukubasan Shrine are especially precious as they contain the mountain's energy and legends.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

For Goshuin collectors, this shrine is a must-visit. This is because you can collect a total of three different Goshuin here.

1. **Tsukubasan Shrine (Haiden)**: Available at the office next to the Haiden at the foot of the mountain. This is the main Goshuin.
2. **Mt. Nantai Honden**: Available at the shop on the summit of Mt. Nantai. It includes the characters for 'Mt. Nantai Summit'.
3. **Mt. Nyotai Honden**: Available at the shop on the summit of Mt. Nyotai. It includes the characters for 'Mt. Nyotai Summit'.
    The joy of collecting all three will make you forget any fatigue from the climb.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono】**

- **Enmusubi Omamori**: A matchmaking charm infused with the energy of the divine couple. The design featuring a pair of pink and blue charms is very popular.
- **Kaeru (Toad) Charms**: Cute charms modeled after the famous toads of Mt. Tsukuba.
  - **Buji-kaeru (無事かえる)**: For a safe return from a trip or business travel.
  - **Waka-gaeru (若がえる)**: To regain youth (for health).
  - **Okane-ga-kaeru (お金がかえる)**: For money to return (financial luck).
    With these various meanings, they make perfect gifts.

### 4. 🍜 Nearby Attractions: The Tastes and Sights of Tsukuba

It would be a shame to leave after only visiting the shrine. Be sure to enjoy the local specialties and food of Mt. Tsukuba.

#### **1. Tsukuba Udon & Kenchin Soba (Miyoshinoya)**

- **Why we recommend it**: You can try these dishes at restaurants like 'Miyoshinoya' in the shopping street right in front of the shrine. They are warm noodle dishes made with the clear water of Mt. Tsukuba and plenty of local vegetables.
- **Tsukuba Udon**: A local specialty filled with character, its name is an acronym for its ingredients: **Tsu**kune (chicken meatballs), **Ku**ro-yasai (black vegetables like burdock root), and **Ba**raniku (pork belly). A fish cake stamped with the character '츠' (Tsu) is its signature feature!

#### **2. Gama no Abura (ガマの油) Street Performance**

- **What to see**: On weekends and holidays, a 'Gama no Abura Kojo Hanbai' (Toad Oil Sales Pitch) performance takes place in the Monzen-machi (shopping street) in front of the shrine. A vendor dressed in Edo-period costume brandishes a sword while giving an amusing performance selling the cure-all toad oil. Don't miss this historic street performance, which is designated as an Intangible Folk Cultural Property of Japan.

#### **3. Stardust Cruising (Night View)**

- **What to enjoy**: From October to February, the ropeway operates at night on weekends. The night view from the summit of Mt. Tsukuba, selected as a 'Japan Night View Heritage,' is a spectacular sight, with the lights of the Kanto Plain twinkling like an overturned jewelry box. It's a perfect way for couples to create unforgettable romantic memories.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

A journey to Tsukubasan Shrine is like taking a trip back in time to ancient Japan.
If the magnificent Mt. Fuji is a mountain 'to be viewed,' the welcoming Mt. Tsukuba is a mountain 'to be climbed and stayed upon.' Just as it did for the gods in the myths, Mt. Tsukuba always embraces us with its generous spirit, no matter when we visit.

When you're tired of daily life and in need of comfort, or when you earnestly wish for a precious connection to enter your life, visit the purple-glowing peaks of Mt. Tsukuba. The divine couple who hold the energy of creation and the fortune-bringing toad just might grant your wish.

**JinjaMap** will return with more stories of beautiful sacred sites across Japan to enrich your soul. May the pure energy of Tsukuba fill your days ahead! 🐸⛰️
