Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, we leave the bustling city of Kyoto behind and guide you to a place filled with the sound of clear water and the sacred energy of the forest. Nestled in a deep mountain valley to the north of Kyoto, **'Kifune Shrine (貴船神社)'** is a mystical sanctuary where the god of water resides.

It is famous for its stone staircase endlessly lined with red lanterns, a sight you may have seen on social media, and for its **'water fortune-telling slips (Mizu-ura Mikuji)'**, where your fortune magically appears when you float a piece of paper on water. Kifune Shrine captivates travelers' hearts with 'Kawadoko' dining over the cool river in summer and with its crimson autumn foliage in the fall. Shall we step into its mystical charm together?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origins: Meeting the God of Water, the Source of Life

Before you pass through the red torii gate of Kifune Shrine, let's first learn about the deity enshrined here and its story.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Takaokami-no-Kami】**

The main deity here is **Takaokami-no-Kami**. The character 'okami (龗)' in the name means dragon, signifying a **dragon god (龍神)** who lives on the mountaintop.
This powerful deity controls the rain and snow and governs the life force of all things. Since ancient times, the imperial court sent messengers here to pray for rain during droughts or for it to stop during long spells of rain, a testament to its spiritual power. As water is the source of all fortune, it is believed to be exceptionally effective for **'improving luck (運気隆昌)'** and **'wish fulfillment (所願成就)'**.

#### **【Origins and History: The Legend of the Yellow Boat】**

The founding of Kifune Shrine dates back about 1,600 years. According to legend, Princess Tamayori-hime, the mother of the first Emperor Jimmu, traveled up the river from Osaka Bay in a yellow boat (kifune). She stopped where a clear spring gushed forth and built a sanctuary to enshrine the water god. This was the beginning of Kifune Shrine.
While the shrine's name 'Kifune' originates from the 'yellow boat', it also holds the deeper meaning of **'the root from which energy is born (kibune, 気生根)'**. This implies that visiting this place helps one regain vitality by receiving its pure energy.

### 2. 🏮 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Red Lanterns and Three Sanctuaries

Kifune Shrine is divided into three areas: the Hongu (Main Shrine), the Nakamiya (Yui-no-yashiro), and the Okumiya (Inner Shrine). Take a slow walk, following the sound of the water.

#### **The Red Lantern Staircase to the Hongu**

After getting off at the bus stop and walking a short distance, you'll see the iconic stone staircase of Kifune Shrine. The red Kasuga lanterns lining both sides create a dreamlike atmosphere against the backdrop of green maple trees. It is beautiful during the day, but when the lights are turned on in the evening, it feels as if you are entering the world of the gods. This is the perfect spot for an unforgettable photo.

#### **The Mystical Water Fortune, Mizu-ura Mikuji**

An absolute must-do when you reach the Hongu! It's the **'water fortune-telling'**. Take a blank white slip of paper and gently float it on the sacred water (Goshinsui) next to the main hall. As the paper gets wet, letters will slowly appear, revealing your fortune. Your heart will flutter the moment you see the message from the water god. (You can also scan a QR code to see a translation in English!)

#### **Yui-no-yashiro (Nakamiya), a Shrine for Tying Bonds**

A little further up from the Hongu is **Yui-no-yashiro**, which enshrines the god of 'matchmaking (enmusubi)'. It is famous for the legend of the renowned Heian period poet, Izumi Shikibu, who prayed here and rekindled her husband's love. It is said that writing your wish on a green slip of paper and tying it here will bring you a good match, so those dreaming of love should be sure to visit.

#### **The Sacred Forest, Okumiya (Inner Shrine)**

Located in the innermost part of the grounds, the Okumiya is the birthplace of Kifune Shrine. It is said that the **'yellow boat'** that Princess Tamayori-hime rode is buried under a pile of stones beneath the main hall. Surrounded by a lush forest, this place has a quiet and solemn atmosphere where you can feel the energy of a true power spot.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Taking Home the Energy of Water

Here's how you can take the pure energy of Kifune Shrine home with you.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here features calligraphy as fluid as flowing water. You can also receive limited-edition goshuin with designs of maple leaves or cherry blossoms depending on the season. They are available at the Hongu office.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Souvenirs】**

- **Musubi Mamori**: An amulet for relationships inspired by the legend of Yui-no-yashiro. Its unique design, folded like a letter, is charming.
- **Mizukoto-suzu (Dragon Water Bell)**: A bell with a clear sound like a water droplet. Just listening to its sound can make you feel cleansed. Available in various colors like pink and blue, it makes a great gift.
- **Salt Amulet**: The purifying salt (Okiyome Shio) for cleansing bad energy is also popular.
