This is not just a park. It is an **'eternal forest,'** created with 100,000 trees voluntarily donated by the people to commemorate Emperor Meiji and his consort, who led Japan's modernization. From the giant tree tunnels that perfectly block out the city noise to a mystical well that grants wishes, and a majestic shrine steeped in 100 years of history.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Sanctuary for the Couple Who Built Modern Japan

Behind the grandeur of Meiji Jingu lies a dramatic story from Japan's modern history.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Emperor Meiji and his Consort】**

The deities enshrined here are **Emperor Meiji (明治天皇)** and his wife, **Empress Shoken (昭憲皇太后)**.
Emperor Meiji was the central figure of the 'Meiji Restoration,' which ended the Edo shogunate era and transformed Japan into a modern nation by embracing Western culture. Empress Shoken was also highly respected for her dedication to women's education and Red Cross activities. The couple was also famous for their loving relationship, making this shrine a sacred place for **marital harmony**, **household safety**, and **matchmaking**.

#### **【Origins and History: A 100-Year-Old Forest Created by the People】**

When Emperor Meiji passed away in 1912, the people wished to build a shrine to honor him. In 1920, 100,000 trees were donated from all over the country, and a youth volunteer corps of 110,000 people dug the ground and planted them.
At the time, experts meticulously planned the arrangement of tree species to ensure it would become a natural forest in 100 years. The dense forest we see today is the result of that plan. In other words, the forest of Meiji Jingu is a massive ecological miracle created by human hands.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Discovering 'Power Spots' Along the Forest Path

Once you pass through the giant torii gate in front of Harajuku Station, a completely different world unfolds. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Ootorii (Grand Gate) & Sake and Wine Barrels**

Standing at the entrance of the southern approach is a massive wooden torii, 12 meters high, the largest of its kind in Japan. Passing through this gate, you'll encounter a unique scene of sake and wine barrels displayed on either side. The juxtaposition of traditional Japanese sake and French Burgundy wine barrels symbolizes the spirit of the Meiji era, which pursued 'Wakon-Yosai' (Japanese spirit with Western technology).

#### **Meoto Kusu (The Couple Camphor Trees)**

In front of the main shrine hall, two enormous camphor trees are connected by a sacred rope (shimenawa). These trees, growing as if leaning on each other like a loving couple, are a powerful 'power spot' for **marital bliss** and **matchmaking**. It is said that praying here can help you meet a good partner or protect the happiness of your family.

#### **Kiyomasa's Well (Kiyomasa no Ido)**

Located within the Meiji Jingu Gyoen (Inner Garden, entrance fee 500 yen), this well is famous as Tokyo's strongest 'power spot'. It is said to have been dug by the Warring States period commander Kato Kiyomasa, and clear water continuously springs from it. An urban legend claims that setting a photo of this well as your phone's wallpaper brings **financial luck** and **good fortune**, which at one point led to hours-long queues. Visiting on a clear morning is said to allow you to receive the best energy.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms: The Dignified Imperial Crest

The charms and souvenirs of Meiji Jingu exude dignity rather than flamboyance.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin here showcases the beauty of simplicity. It consists only of the weighty characters for '明治神宮' and the Imperial **chrysanthemum crest (a 16-petal chrysanthemum)**, yet it commands an overwhelming sense of authority and grace.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Soseiju (Couple's Amulet)**: An amulet set inspired by the Couple Camphor Trees. When a couple or partners each carry one, their love is said to deepen.
- **Kodama (Wooden Bell)**: A bell made from the wood of the shrine's forest. Its clear and pure sound is believed to ward off evil and bring good fortune.
- **Heart Amulet for Happiness**: An amulet with heart-shaped embroidery, offered as a prayer for peace of mind and spiritual healing.
