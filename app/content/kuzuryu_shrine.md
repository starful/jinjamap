Hello, this is the editor from 'JinjaMap,' introducing sacred places where you can find solace for your soul away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Just an hour and a half by train from Tokyo, in Hakone (箱根), beloved for its hot springs and stunning views of Mt. Fuji, lies the deep, blue Lake Ashi (芦ノ湖), which holds a thousand-year-old myth. The place we are heading to today is **Kuzuryu Shrine Shingu (九頭龍神社 新宮)**, which enshrines the master of this lake, the legendary nine-headed dragon god (龍神).

This is not just a tourist spot. It is a land steeped in a dramatic story of a violent dragon that once harmed people, only to be transformed into a guardian deity through the spiritual power of a high priest. Thanks to its powerful energy, it has now become one of Japan's top power spots, attracting a constant stream of visitors from all over the country seeking good relationships (Enmusubi) and financial fortune.

From the red shrine you encounter after passing through a dense cedar forest path, to the mysterious sacred water (霊水) gushing forth before it. Shall we begin a special pilgrimage with me into Hakone's mystical forest to feel the breath of the dragon god firsthand?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: From a Poisonous Dragon to a Guardian Deity

When visiting a shrine, the first thing to look into is the deity (神) and the stories enshrined there. The background of Kuzuryu Shrine's birth contains a narrative as dramatic as a movie.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): The Dragon God Who Opens All Fortunes】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Kuzuryu Okami (九頭龍大神)**, meaning the 'Great Nine-Headed Dragon God.'
Water is the source of life and a symbol of wealth. Therefore, the dragon god who controls water has long been revered as a deity of **financial luck (金運向上)** and **business prosperity (商売繁盛)**.

However, what makes Kuzuryu Okami even more special is its powerful efficacy in **'matchmaking (縁結び)'**.
It attracts not only romantic love between men and women but all positive connections in life, such as meeting benefactors (貴人) who will help you and connecting with business partners. Its immense power of **opening fortune and inviting happiness (開運招福)** is also remarkable, making it a great source of support for those wishing to face a turning point in their lives.

#### **【Origin and History: A Thousand-Year Oath】**

The story goes back to the Nara period (奈良時代).
At that time, a ferocious nine-headed poisonous dragon lived in Lake Ashi. This dragon frequently caused storms and floods, devastating the villages. Terrified villagers had to appease the dragon with tears by offering a young maiden as a human sacrifice every year.

It was then that a high priest named **Mangan Shonin (万巻上人)**, who was practicing asceticism on Mt. Hakone, learned of this tragedy. To save the people, he went to the middle of the lake, bound the dragon with chains using his spiritual power, and for three days and nights, he chanted Buddhist scriptures, scolding and persuading the dragon.
Eventually, moved by Mangan Shonin's sincerity and spiritual power, the dragon shed tears of repentance and made an oath.
_"I will never harm humans again and will become the guardian deity of this land to help people."_

With that oath, the poisonous dragon was reborn as the benevolent **Kuzuryu Okami**. The 'Hongu' (本宮, main shrine) was built deep on the lake's shore to commemorate this. However, the Hongu was a place that could only be reached by boat or a long walk through the forest. So, to allow more people to receive the dragon god's blessings, the **'Shingu' (新宮, new shrine)** was established within the grounds of Hakone Shrine in the year 2000 (Heisei 12), making it easily accessible for everyone to worship.

### 2. 🌲 A Walk Through the Precincts: The Red Shrine and the Water of Life

Kuzuryu Shrine Shingu is located right next to the Hakone Shrine grounds. Just walking along the magnificent approach to Hakone Shrine is enough to begin the purification of your heart.

#### **Worshipping Alongside Hakone Shrine**

Pass through the giant **'Heiwa no Torii' (Peace Torii)** standing tall by the shore of Lake Ashi and walk along the path lined with cedar trees that seem to pierce the sky. After climbing the 89 stone steps and paying respects at the main hall of Hakone Shrine, turn your head to the right, and the Kuzuryu Shrine Shingu, small yet radiating a powerful aura, will reveal itself.
The shrine building is modest compared to Hakone Shrine, but the combination of red lacquer and a serene atmosphere fosters a deeper connection with the deity. Here, recall the dragon god's thousand-year-old oath and offer a heartfelt prayer.

#### **【Essential Power Spot: Ryujinsui (龍神水)】**

There is one place at Kuzuryu Shrine Shingu that you must absolutely not miss. It is the **'Ryujinsui (龍神水)'** located in front of the worship hall.
Clear, cold water gushes endlessly from the mouths of a nine-headed dragon sculpture. This water is natural spring water from deep within Mt. Hakone and is said to be filled with the dragon god's energy.

- **Purification (浄化)**: Rinsing your mouth and washing your hands with this water is believed to cleanse all impurities from your body and mind.
- **Boosting Luck**: Thanks to the legend that *"drinking this water improves one's luck in love and money,"* many people line up to drink and collect the water. It is said that if you put it in a special bottle sold at the shrine office and take it home to drink or use in cooking, good energy will spread throughout your home.

The moment the cold Ryujinsui flows down your throat, feel a refreshing clarity that reaches deep within your body. It might not be just water, but the very energy of hope itself.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Taking Home the Dragon God's Energy

At the Hakone Shrine amulet office (授与所), you can receive special goshuin and omamori from Kuzuryu Shrine.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kuzuryu Shrine is overflowing with power. The characters **'九頭龍神社 (Kuzuryu Jinja)'** written powerfully with a brush in the center make you feel the dragon's spirit just by looking at them. The date of your visit is written alongside the vermilion shrine seal, and visiting during the monthly festival (Tsukinamisai) held on the 13th of every month will make your worship even more meaningful.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Ryujinsui-exclusive PET Bottle**: A small, gourd-shaped PET bottle with a dragon illustration. It's an essential item for taking Ryujinsui home and also makes for a wonderful souvenir (engimono). (Usually available for around 100 yen.)
- **Enmusubi Omamori (Matchmaking Charm)**: Often shaped as a pair for a couple or two small charms connected by a string. Sharing it with a partner deepens love, while carrying it alone attracts a good match.
- **Kinryu-mamori (Golden Dragon Charm)**: Recommended for those wishing for financial luck. This charm, with a dragon intricately embroidered with gold thread, is said to protect your wealth when kept in your wallet.
- **Dragon God Crystal Strap**: A strap with a dragon carved inside a clear crystal provides a sense of reassurance that you are always under the dragon god's protection in your daily life.

### 4. 🛳️ Places to Visit Nearby: Into Hakone's Scenic Beauty

After visiting Kuzuryu Shrine Shingu, here are some recommended spots to fully enjoy Hakone's nature.

#### **1. Lake Ashi Cruise (Pirate Ship)**

- **Why it's recommended**: It's an experience of crossing Lake Ashi, the very stage of the Kuzuryu legend. The view of the red **'Heiwa no Torii'** from the lake, with Mt. Fuji in the background, is the exact scene you've seen on postcards. You can board from Motohakone Port.

#### **2. Amazake Chaya (甘酒茶屋)**

- **Why it's recommended**: A traditional teahouse that has served as a resting place for travelers for 400 years since the Edo period. A warm cup of **amazake (sweet, non-alcoholic sake)** under a thatched roof, amidst the scent of a hearth, tastes like heaven. The subtle sweetness, derived only from rice without added sugar, perfectly soothes the fatigue of your pilgrimage. The charcoal-grilled rice cakes (chikara mochi) are also a delicacy.
- **How to get there**: Take the Hakone Tozan Bus (K/H lines) and get off at the 'Amazake-chaya' stop.

#### **3. Hakone Shrine (箱根神社)**

- **Why it's recommended**: This is the main shrine where the Shingu is located. With a history of 1260 years, it is the head shrine (Sōchinju) of the Kanto region, known for granting luck in competitions and traffic safety. The giant 'Heiwa no Torii', which stands partially submerged in the lake, is an iconic photo spot for any trip to Hakone.
