### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The first step to understanding a shrine is to know the deity enshrined there and the story of its founding.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】**

The main enshrined deity (主祭神) of Akita Suwa-miya is **Takeminakata-no-kami (建御名方神)**.

He is the son of Okuninushi-no-mikoto, a central figure in the 'nation-building' mythology. He is a god of agriculture who governs wind and water, and also a powerful **god of war (軍神)**, as his name includes the character 'Take' (建, meaning valiant). With his overflowing power and bravery, he has been deeply revered by warriors since ancient times.

Today, he is believed to bring blessings in various areas, including **improving luck in competition (勝運), business prosperity, warding off evil and inviting good fortune (開運厄除), bountiful harvests, and traffic safety**. He is a dependable source of support for those facing significant challenges or starting new endeavors.

#### **【Origin and History: A Warlord's Vow and a God's Response】**

The shrine's history dates back about 400 years to the turbulent Sengoku period. The protagonist is **Rokugo Masanori (六郷政乗)**, a Sengoku daimyo who served Tokugawa Ieyasu.

In 1614, while participating in the 'Winter Siege of Osaka,' Masanori prayed fervently to the night sky. He vowed to the god of the Suwa Grand Shrine, which his ancestors had worshiped for generations, 'If you grant me victory, I will build a magnificent shrine in my domain.' His prayers were answered; the Tokugawa forces were victorious, and Masanori himself achieved great distinction.

After the war, Ieyasu recognized his merits and granted him a domain in Honjo, Dewa Province (present-day Akita). As the new lord of the land, Masanori fulfilled his battlefield promise. He invited the spirit of the deity from Suwa Grand Shrine and established this shrine in 1623. This marks the beginning of Akita Suwa-miya Shrine.

Thus, this place is a historical product born from a warrior's firm belief and promise, and a god's response. Visitors can feel the earnest heart of 400 years ago within the shrine grounds.

### 2. Strolling the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

#### **【Main Hall (Honden, 本殿) & Hall of Worship (Haiden, 拝殿)】**

Passing through the torii gate and walking along the approach, you will find a wooden hall of worship exuding a dignified atmosphere. The curves of the roof and the intricate decorations, characteristic of early Edo period architectural aesthetics, are impressive. Here, offer your prayers with the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' (二拝二拍手一拝) etiquette, conveying Rokugo Masanori's gratitude and your own wishes.

#### **【The Miraculous Divine Tree (ご神木), Mizunara (水楢)】**

The most powerful spot at Akita Suwa-miya Shrine, which you absolutely should not miss, is the giant **Mizunara (Japanese oak)** tree towering within the grounds.

According to legend, when Rokugo Masanori first set foot on this land, he stuck a Mizunara branch he was using as a staff into the ground and declared, 'If this land is to be the foundation of my family's prosperity, this will sprout.' Miraculously, the staff, which was just a dry branch, took root and sprouted. Now, 400 years later, it has become a colossal tree that seems to pierce the sky.

As you touch its rough bark, feel the powerful life force that made the impossible possible and the energy of a firm will toward a goal. It is highly recommended for those about to embark on a new beginning.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets (授与品): A Memento of Your Visit

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The ink calligraphy brushed by a priest onto white Japanese paper is like a work of art. The powerfully written 'Suwa-miya (諏訪宮)' in the center and the red seal carry the deep meaning of forging a connection with the deity. Limited edition goshuin are also available on special occasions.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

- **Kachi-mamori (勝ち守 - Victory Amulet)**: This is the representative amulet, directly linked to the shrine's origin. It conveys Rokugo Masanori's luck in victory to those facing important competitions like exams, job hunting, or sports matches.
- **Mizunara Divine Tree Amulet**: A special amulet containing a piece of wood from the miraculous divine tree. It provides the strength to overcome adversity, achieve goals, and settle into new environments.
- **Good Fortune and Success Amulet**: An amulet that aids in social success and promotion, much like Masanori's own rise.
