Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

Today, I want to introduce you to the ultimate power spot that anyone who loves 'money'—not just in Japan, but around the world—dreams of visiting. Its name is powerful in itself: 'Kanemochi (金持)'. Doesn't the existence of a shrine with such a direct name, meaning 'rich person' in Japanese, pique your curiosity?

Nestled deep in the mountains of Tottori Prefecture, surrounded by a mystical forest, **Kanemochi Shrine (金持神社)** is more than just a place with a catchy name. It is a genuine sacred site, steeped in ancient history, legends, and countless testimonials of people "hitting the jackpot." Allow me to unravel the profound story of why this place became Japan's top sanctuary for financial luck.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Shrine

The moment you step into the precincts of Kanemochi Shrine, you are greeted by the powerful aura of gods who govern not just financial luck, but primordial creation and prosperity. The main deities (主祭神) enshrined here are three gods who symbolize foundational power in Japanese mythology.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

- **Ame-no-tokotachi-no-kami (天之常立神)**
  As one of the first deities to appear when heaven and earth were created, this highly revered god symbolizes the eternal foundation of the heavens. This deity governs the beginning and stability of all things, possessing the profound blessing of laying the groundwork for all prosperity. It is a god who reminds us that an unshakable foundation is the first necessity for building wealth.

- **Yatsukamizuomizunu-no-mikoto (八束水臣津野命)**
  This is the protagonist of the "Kunibiki Shinwa (国引き神話)," the land-pulling creation myth of the Izumo region. He is a deity from a grand legend who, to expand the insufficient land, pulled land from across the sea with giant ropes to enlarge the territory of Izumo. He symbolizes the powerful force of 'attracting what is not there, filling what is lacking, and making the small grow large.' In modern times, he is deeply worshipped as a god who increases wealth and assets.

- **Ōkuninushi-no-mikoto (大国主命)**
  As the central deity of Izumo mythology, he is beloved throughout Japan as the god of 'matchmaking (縁結び)' and 'nation-building (国造り)'. His myth, in which he overcomes numerous trials to build a prosperous nation, translates into the power to protect all processes of creating wealth through business prosperity, success, and good relationships.

The enshrinement of these three deities together signifies that Kanemochi Shrine is not merely a place to pray for material wealth like 'money.' It is a sacred site that embodies a deep aspiration: to build upon the foundational stability of the world (Ame-no-tokotachi-no-kami), to attract assets with the powerful force of creating something from nothing (Yatsukamizuomizunu-no-mikoto), and to achieve true prosperity through the good relationships and wisdom formed in the process (Ōkuninushi-no-mikoto).

#### **【Origins and History: When Iron (鉄) Became Money (金)】**

Kanemochi Shrine is nestled in the tranquil mountains of Tottori Prefecture. Its name, 'Kanemochi (金持),' which literally means 'to have money,' has earned it a reputation as Japan's foremost power spot for financial luck. But behind this name lies layers of ancient myths and the history of the people who have protected this land.

While the exact founding year of the shrine is unclear, records from 810 show that a Shinto priest from Izumo enshrined the gods and performed rituals here, suggesting a history of over a thousand years. The shrine's deepest roots are connected to the aforementioned "Kunibiki Shinwa." The legend of Yatsukamizuomizunu-no-mikoto shouting "Kuni-ko, kuni-ko (国来、国来)"—"Land, come here, land"—while pulling the land is integral to the identity of this region, which stretches from western Tottori Prefecture to eastern Shimane Prefecture. This grand myth sanctified the acts of 'pulling, gathering, and increasing,' which later became the foundation of the faith for attracting wealth and assets.

So, where did the unique place name 'Kanemochi' come from? Alongside the mythological background, there is a very practical historical reason. This area has been a rich source of high-quality iron sand (砂鉄) since ancient times. Iron sand is an essential resource for making *tamahagane* (玉鋼), the raw material for Japanese swords (*Nihontō*). From antiquity to the medieval period, the iron-making technology known as *tatara seitetsu* (たたら製鉄) was the core industry supporting the region's economy.

The word 'kane' (カネ) for 'iron' (鉄) is pronounced the same as 'kane' (金) for 'money.' In other words, the people of this land were those who 'possessed the skills to handle iron'—they were 'kane (鉄) o motsu (持)' people, and this was their source of wealth. The place name, meaning 'a land rich in iron,' naturally settled into 'Kanemochi (金持),' meaning 'a land of wealth.' The creative power of myth and the prosperity of the real-world iron industry converged, establishing Kanemochi Shrine as a true sanctuary of 'wealth' (富).

Entering the Meiji era, the shrine's name was officially changed to 'Kanemochi Shrine,' and the powerful energy of its name spread throughout the country by word of mouth. With a continuous stream of modern success stories—lottery wins, business success, stock market triumphs—it now attracts countless worshippers from all over Japan, each carrying their earnest prayers. The shrine's history is a crystalization of over a millennium of aspirations, forged by the grandeur of myth and the history of the land itself.

### 2. A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The precincts of Kanemochi Shrine are not grand or ornate, but they exude a unique and powerful energy, blending the serene spirit of the forest with the earnest prayers of its visitors. I encourage you to walk slowly and feel the shrine's aura with your entire body.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) & Hall of Worship (Haiden)**

As you walk along the main path (*sandō*), the simple yet dignified Hall of Worship (*Haiden*) comes into view. This is the space where visitors offer their prayers to the gods. Here, you should convey your feelings with reverence, following the basic etiquette of Japanese shrine worship: 'two bows, two claps, one bow' (*nirei nihakushu ichirei*).

1. Quietly place a coin into the offering box (*saisen-bako*).
2. Bow deeply twice at a 90-degree angle (*nirei*).
3. Clap your hands twice at chest height (*nihakushu*). A formal technique is to slightly lower your right hand below your left at the first joint, then align them as you clap.
4. With your hands still together, offer your earnest prayer.
5. Conclude with another deep 90-degree bow (*ichirei*).

Behind the Haiden lies the Main Hall (*Honden*), the most sacred space where the deity resides. While ordinary visitors cannot see it directly, you can pray with the belief that you are connecting with the god of the Honden through the Haiden. The shrine's buildings are designated as important cultural properties of Tottori Prefecture, recognized for their high historical value, and they create a sacred atmosphere in harmony with the surrounding dense cedar forest.

#### **Symbolic Torii and Yellow Handkerchiefs in the Precincts**

The most striking feature within the precincts is undoubtedly the countless 'yellow handkerchiefs' (*kiiroi hankachi*) tied by visitors. The color yellow has long been considered a symbol of financial luck and good fortune. Visitors purchase these yellow handkerchiefs, write their wishes on them, and carefully tie them to tree branches to convey their prayers to the gods.

The sight of thousands of yellow handkerchiefs fluttering in the wind is a spectacle in itself and a powerful visual representation of the accumulated positive energy of countless people. Just gazing at this scene can make you feel a sense of abundance. If you visit, be sure to write your dreams on a handkerchief of your own.

#### **Hidden Gems & Power Spots**

- **Sazare-ishi (さざれ石)**
  The 'Sazare-ishi,' which appears in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem "Kimigayo," means 'small pebbles.' This stone is formed over immense periods as small pebbles conglomerate into a single large boulder through substances like limestone. It carries the auspicious meaning of unity, prosperity, and eternity over the passage of time. The Sazare-ishi at Kanemochi Shrine is a power spot where you can touch the stone and absorb its energy, praying that your personal wealth and family line will remain strong and last for generations, much like the prosperity of the nation.

- **Sacred Tree (Go-shinboku) - Chanchin Tree (チャンチン)**
  The grounds of Kanemochi Shrine are home to a forest of giant cedar trees, some of which are hundreds of years old. Among them, a particularly eye-catching tree is a rare species called 'Chanchin' (チャンチン). This tree, a type of Chinese mahogany, is incredibly beautiful in spring when its new shoots emerge in a vibrant red color. These red shoots seem to symbolize blazing life force and new beginnings, and they are said to give great courage and inspiration to those starting a business or facing a new challenge. It is recommended to gently touch the tree and feel its ancient life force and positive energy.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets (Juyohin): Proof of Your Visit

After your worship, receiving a *goshuin* (shrine seal) and *omamori* (amulets) as a memento of your connection with the deity is a great pleasure. Kanemochi Shrine is filled with special items befitting its name.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kanemochi Shrine is considered one of the most 'desirable' of all. The three characters for '金持神社' (Kanemochi Jinja), boldly written in the center with black ink, seem to radiate a powerful aura of financial luck just by looking at them. Each stroke embodies the shrine's long history and the dignity of its gods, completed with a vermilion shrine seal.

During special periods, they may use gold ink or offer limited-edition designs, so it's a good idea to check the official website before your visit. Adding this page to your goshuin-chō (goshuin book) is more than just collecting; it's a meaningful act of preserving the precious connection you've made with the gods of Kanemochi Shrine for a lifetime.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

The shrine's office (*juyosho*), where amulets are offered, is like a treasure chest. It is filled with creative and reputedly effective *omamori* (amulets) and *engimono* (lucky charms) related to financial luck, making the selection process a joy.

1.  **Financial Luck Yellow Handkerchief Amulet (金運黄色いハンカチお守り)**: This is the very same handkerchief that paints the precincts yellow. You can carry it as an amulet or write your wish on it and leave it tied at the shrine. It is the most representative souvenir and a symbol of prayer.
2.  **Gold Ingot Amulet for Your Wallet (お財布用 金塊守)**: This small, gold-ingot-shaped amulet is said to attract money when kept inside your wallet. Its glittering gold color provides a visual sense of abundance, and it's extremely popular as you can carry it with you at all times to boost your financial luck.
3.  **Iron Sand Koban Amulet (砂鉄入り 勾玉お守り)**: A special amulet containing 'iron sand' (*satetsu*), the historical root of Kanemochi Shrine. Inside the shape of a *koban* (an old Japanese oval coin), it contains precious iron sand collected from this region. This signifies carrying the shrine's foundational energy of wealth directly. It is recommended for those who wish to receive the power of both history and myth.
4.  **Lottery Winning Prayer Charm (宝くじ当選祈願札)**: Charms for more direct wishes are also available. If you have a lottery ticket or an important drawing coming up, receive this charm and pray with all your heart. Many visitors have left testimonials about the effectiveness of this charm.

There are many other amulets with various designs and blessings, so take your time to choose the one that best suits your wishes and cherish it.
