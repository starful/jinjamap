  Healing and Wish Fulfillment at Fujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha'

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap', traveling to discover the great heritage sites of the world.

Today, we journey to the foot of Mt. Fuji, the sacred mountain (霊山) and symbol of Japan. We are in Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture, home to **'Fujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha (富士山本宮浅間大社)'**, the head shrine of the 1,300 Sengen shrines across the country that worship Mt. Fuji as a deity.

This is a premier power spot where the potent energy of Mt. Fuji meets its pure waters. In particular, the mystical **'Wakutamaike Pond'**, which springs forth year-round without drying up, is a healing spot that purifies the mind just by looking at it.

Gazing at the majestic Mt. Fuji rising behind the vermilion shrine, this is a special journey to soak up the abundant energy of nature. Let's begin.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Goddess Who Calmed the Volcano's Fury

Sengen Taisha's history is intertwined with that of Mt. Fuji.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Konohananosakuya-hime】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Konohananosakuya-hime**. Her name means 'princess as beautiful as a blossoming tree flower,' and she is the goddess of cherry blossoms and the deity of Mt. Fuji.
According to legend, she gave birth in the midst of a fire, and is thus revered as the goddess of **'safe childbirth'**, **'child-rearing'**, and **'fire prevention'**. As a beautiful goddess, she is also said to grant blessings for **'beauty'** and **'matchmaking'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Center of Mt. Fuji Worship】**

Its origins date back 2,000 years, when a shrine was established at the foot of the mountain to appease the wrath of the constantly erupting Mt. Fuji.
Later, in 806, the great general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro built a magnificent shrine at its current location, making it the center of Mt. Fuji worship. Tokugawa Ieyasu also donated the current main hall in gratitude after his victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, giving it immense historical value.
Interestingly, the entire area of Mt. Fuji from the 8th station upwards is the property of this shrine! (It's even registered that way in the official land registry.)

### 2. 🗻 Strolling the Grounds: Mystical Spring Water and a Two-Story Shrine

The shrine grounds are filled with the pure energy of Mt. Fuji. Here are the key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Sengen-zukuri (浅間造) Main Hall**

The main hall, built by Ieyasu, features the unique **'Sengen-zukuri'** architectural style, which is not seen anywhere else in Japan. It looks as if a second story has been placed atop a single-story building, symbolizing the height and nobility of Mt. Fuji. (Designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan)

#### **Wakutamaike Pond (湧玉池)**

The highlight of the shrine! This is a spring-fed pond where snow and rain from Mt. Fuji, filtered underground for decades, gushes out. The daily output is a staggering 200,000 tons! Trout swim in the crystal-clear water, and the temperature remains a constant 13°C year-round. In the past, pilgrims would purify themselves here before ascending the mountain.

#### **Mizuya Shrine & Receiving Sacred Water**

Next to Wakutamaike Pond is the **'Mizuya Shrine'**, which enshrines the god of water. Here, you can collect the **'sacred water' (神水)**, infused with the spirit of Mt. Fuji, in your own bottle. Legend says that drinking it brings good health, so be sure to bring an empty water bottle.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Items: Blessings of Cherry Blossoms and Mt. Fuji

The items offered at Sengen Taisha are beautiful in themselves.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here features the bold calligraphy for **'Fujisan Hongu (富士山本宮)'** along with an illustration of Mt. Fuji. Combining it with the goshuin from the Okumiya shrine at the summit of Mt. Fuji (open only in summer) completes the perfect pilgrimage.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Cherry Blossom Bell Charm**: A bell shaped like a cherry blossom, the symbol of the goddess. Its clear sound is said to ward off evil spirits and enhance beauty and artistic talent.
- **Mt. Fuji Charm**: A cute charm modeled after the shape of Mt. Fuji. It carries the energy of being 'Japan's No. 1' to pray for wish fulfillment and success.
- **Safe Childbirth Charm**: Borrows the power of the goddess who gave birth in fire to aid in a safe delivery.
