Hello, dear readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap', here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to Hōfu City in Yamaguchi Prefecture, at the western tip of Japan's Honshu island. Here lies **'Hōfu Tenman-gū (防府天満宮)'**, a shrine that proudly holds the title of 'the first Tenman-gū in Japan,' being the very first to be established among the 12,000 Tenman-gū shrines across the country.

This is the historic site where the ill-fated genius scholar 'Sugawara no Michizane' stopped during his unjust exile, shedding tears as he longed for the capital of Kyoto he had left behind. Built to appease his vengeful spirit, this place has now become a sanctuary of hope, supporting the dreams and exam success of countless people.

Shall we embark on a journey through time with me, into the spectacular scenery created by the beautiful red tower gate and 1,000 plum trees?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The First Tenman-gū, Born from a Tragic Exile

The beginning of Hōfu Tenman-gū is like a sad historical drama.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Sugawara no Michizane】**

The deity enshrined here is **Sugawara no Michizane (Tenjin-sama)**.
As the foremost scholar and statesman of the Heian period, he is revered as the 'God of Learning' and the 'God of Sincerity (至誠),' who never lost his truthful heart. That is why this place is always bustling with people praying for **academic achievement**, **success in exams**, and **the fulfillment of wishes**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Tears of a Deified Scholar】**

In 901, Michizane was unjustly demoted to Dazaifu in Kyushu due to the slander of his political rivals. On his way to exile, he briefly stayed at the port of Hōfu. He climbed a hill, looked towards the eastern sky (Kyoto), and tearfully pleaded his innocence. He passed away in solitude in Dazaifu two years later.
In 904, the year after his death, a mysterious light and clouds appeared at the place where he had stayed. Finding this strange, people built a shrine, which marked the beginning of Hōfu Tenman-gū. This predates both Dazaifu Tenman-gū and Kitano Tenman-gū, making it a record of being **'the first in Japan'**.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Red Rōmon Gate and the Love-Granting Ox

As you climb the stone steps, a panoramic view of Hōfu city unfolds before you.

#### **The Majestic Rōmon Gate and Haiden (Worship Hall)**

Standing at the top of the steep stone steps, the red **Rōmon (tower gate)** is the symbol of Hōfu Tenman-gū. Its magnificent and splendid appearance overwhelms visitors. Passing through the Rōmon, you will find the Haiden (Worship Hall) and Honden (Main Hall), which are designated as National Important Cultural Properties and showcase the essence of Edo-period architecture. Offer your prayers here with reverence, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' custom.

#### **The Love-Granting Ox (Koi-ushi)**

There are several statues of oxen on the grounds, as the ox is the messenger of Tenjin-sama. The **'Koi-ushi (Love Ox)'** is particularly popular among couples, as legend has it that rubbing its head while praying for romantic success will make your love come true. You can feel the countless wishes of people from the polished head of the ox.

#### **Sazare-ishi (Pebble Rock)**

You can see an actual **'Sazare-ishi'**, which appears in the lyrics of the Japanese national anthem, "Kimigayo." The sight of small pebbles coalescing into a large rock symbolizes the passage of long years and eternal prosperity.

#### **Tea House Hōshōan (芳松庵)**

Deep within the shrine grounds, you will find the beautiful Japanese garden and tea house, **'Hōshōan'**. The leisure of enjoying matcha and Japanese sweets while gazing at the tranquil garden will help you forget the fatigue of your journey. It boasts a spectacular view during the autumn foliage season. (Separate admission fee required)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Marks of Success and Intellect

These are special items imbued with the pride of being the first Tenman-gū in Japan.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin of Hōfu Tenman-gū is highly collectible as it is clearly stamped with the phrase **'日本最初 天満宮 (The First Tenman-gū in Japan)'**. You may also receive limited-edition Goshuin during the plum blossom or autumn foliage seasons.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Passing Exam Charm**: A must-have for students! The pentagon-shaped charm is popular because the pronunciation of 'gokaku' (pentagon) is the same as 'gōkaku' (pass).
- **Tobiume Pencil**: It is said that studying with this pencil, which embodies the legend of the plum blossom that flew from Kyoto, will clear your mind.
- **Bell of Intellect**: The clear sound of the bell brings peace of mind.

### 4. 🍽️ Nearby Attractions: A Feudal Lord's Garden and Sea Bream Cuisine

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the history and flavors of Yamaguchi.

#### **1. Mōri Clan Garden & Museum**

- **Access**: 10 minutes by car.
- **Features**: This is the grand residence and nationally designated scenic garden of the Mōri family, who ruled this region. It's a famous spot for its beautiful cherry blossoms in spring and autumn leaves, allowing you to experience the essence of Japanese aristocratic culture.

#### **3. Tenjin Saryō Wanotsuki (Sea Bream Ochazuke)**

- **Location**: Just below the shrine.
- **Menu**: After your visit, I recommend the **'Tai Ochazuke'** set meal. The simple yet savory taste of fresh sea bream sashimi placed on rice with hot green tea poured over it is exquisite.
