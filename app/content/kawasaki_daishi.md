  Peace and Vitality at Kawasaki Daishi'

Hello, dear readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to the Kanto region's foremost sacred site for **'warding off evil (yakuyoke),'** located just 20 minutes by train from Tokyo and visited by over 10 million worshippers annually. This is **'Kawasaki Daishi (川崎大師)'** in Kawasaki City.

Although it is a Buddhist temple, not a Shinto shrine, it is a center of faith deeply woven into the lives of the Japanese people. It is a place steeped in the legend of a falsely accused samurai who made a miraculous comeback through the guidance of a high priest, and it's a hotspot that becomes incredibly crowded every New Year with people seeking to ward off evil and pray for good fortune.

From the shopping street echoing with the cheerful sound of candy being cut to the majestic five-storied pagoda, shall we venture together into Kawasaki Daishi, a place brimming with vibrant energy?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: A Miracle Pulled from the Sea

The prestige of Kawasaki Daishi begins with a dramatic legend from a thousand years ago.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (Gohonzon): Yakuyoke Kobo Daishi】**

The main deity here is **'Yakuyoke (Evil-Warding) Kobo Daishi.'** 'Kobo Daishi' is an honorific title for the monk **Kukai**, the founder of the Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism.
He is revered as a living Buddha and is especially famous for his miraculous power to **dispel evil fortune**, **prevent disasters**, and **grant wishes**. This is why people facing critical years in their lives (yakudoshi) flock here from all over the country.

#### **【Origin and History: A Samurai's Dream and a Fisherman's Net】**

In 1128, a samurai named Hirama Kanenori, who was living as a fisherman after being unjustly exiled, received a revelation from a high priest in a dream. The next day, when he cast his net into the sea, he pulled up a brilliantly shining **wooden statue of Kobo Daishi**.
After he enshrined the statue with great care, a miracle occurred: his false accusations were cleared, and he was reinstated to his samurai status. A high priest named Sonken, hearing of this, founded a temple. This was the beginning of 'Hirama's Temple,' Kawasaki Daishi (Heiken-ji). It is truly a land of miracles where hope was salvaged from despair.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Overwhelming Four Heavenly Kings and the Red Pagoda

The temple grounds are a space where solemnity and tranquility coexist. Here are the must-see points.

#### **Daisanmon (Main Gate) and the Shitenno**

The massive gate at the entrance, the **'Daisanmon,'** is overwhelming. On either side of the gate stand colossal statues of the Shitenno (Four Heavenly Kings), with glaring eyes to ward off evil spirits. Just passing through this gate feels as if a weight has been lifted from your mind.

#### **Dai-Hondo (Main Hall) and the Ogoma (Homa) Ritual**

In the Main Hall, the **'Ogoma (Homa)'** ritual is performed daily. It is a solemn ceremony where monks light a sacred fire and chant sutras to burn away worldly desires and evil fortune. Experience the powerful energy created by the combination of drum beats and blazing flames.

#### **Hakkaku Gojunoto (Octagonal Five-Storied Pagoda)**

Next to the Main Hall stands the magnificent **'Octagonal Five-Storied Pagoda,'** adorned in red and gold. This octagonal, five-storied pagoda is a rare and unique architectural style in Japan, making it the best spot for photos.

#### **The Healing Nade-Yakushi**

In front of the Yakushi-den Hall, there is a statue called **'Nade-Yakushi.'** It is believed that if you rub the same part of the statue as your ailment, it will be healed. As a result, the statue's knees and shoulders are always polished smooth. Rub it while praying for good health.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**
