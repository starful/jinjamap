### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Meeting the Heart of the Sanctuary

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神)】**

The first step to understanding Saijo Inari is to know the deity enshrined here, the 'Gohonzon (御本尊)'. Unlike typical shrines that enshrine Shinto gods (kami), this place enshrines **'Saijoikyo-o Daibosatsu (最上位経王大菩薩)'** as its main object of worship. As the name suggests, it is a Bodhisattva, a Buddhist figure.

Saijoikyo-o Daibosatsu is known as a being with a compassionate heart and immense power to save people from all hardships and grant their wishes. Its blessings are said to be extensive, covering all aspects of worldly benefits such as **business prosperity (商売繁盛)**, **family safety (家内安全)**, **traffic safety (交通安全)**, and **success in exams (合格祈願)**. It has been a profound object of faith, especially for business owners, as a deity that brings wealth and prosperity.

Interestingly, Saijo Inari bears the name 'Inari (稲荷)'. Originally, the Inari deity is a Shinto god, 'Ukanomitama-no-kami (宇迦之御魂神)', the god of grains and abundance. However, here, a unique form of faith exists where a Buddhist Bodhisattva appears in the form of the Inari deity to save people. This is one of the most dramatic examples of Japan's unique **Shinbutsu-shūgō (神仏習合, the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism)**, creating a mystical landscape where the shrine's symbolic red torii gates coexist with the architectural style of a temple.

#### **【Origin and History】**

The history of Saijo Inari dates back over 1200 years to the Nara period. Its founding story begins with a miraculous legend involving a high priest and the imperial family.

In the year 752, Emperor Kōken (孝謙天皇) fell gravely ill. When all remedies failed and the entire nation was filled with anxiety, an imperial order was given to the renowned 'High Priest Hōon Daishi (報恩大師)' to pray for the emperor's recovery. Hōon Daishi entered Mt. Ryuo (龍王山), where Saijo Inari now stands, and began to pray with unwavering determination.

One night, while deep in prayer, an elderly man with white hair suddenly appeared before him in a ray of light. The old man identified himself as 'Saijoikyo-o Daibosatsu' and revealed the location of a mysterious, miraculous medicinal herb. Hōon Daishi followed the revelation, found the herb, and presented it to the emperor. Miraculously, the emperor's illness was completely cured.

Deeply moved, the emperor wished to reward Hōon Daishi. The high priest requested permission to build a temple on Mt. Ryuo to enshrine the miraculous Daibosatsu for the well-being of the emperor and the peace of the nation. Thus, 'Ryuo-zan Shingū-ji (龍王山神宮寺)', the predecessor of Saijo Inari, was established.

Over the long years that followed, Saijo Inari prospered, receiving the faith of countless people. Its status was further elevated, especially after the Warring States period ended and the Edo period began, under the devoted patronage of the Ikeda clan (池田家), the lords of the Bizen Okayama domain. The lords provided generous support to Saijo Inari to pray for the prosperity and peace of their domain, which led to the faith spreading widely among the common people. As the name 'Inari' suggests, for those engaged in commerce and agriculture, Saijo Inari was a place of hope that promised a bountiful life.

However, Saijo Inari also faced a great trial. In the late 19th century, the **'Shinbutsu Bunri-rei (神仏分離令)'** (Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order), enacted along with the Meiji Restoration, was a policy that strictly separated shrines and temples across Japan and prohibited the syncretic forms of Shinbutsu-shūgō. This caused many temples and shrines to change their form or suffer the pain of destruction.

Saijo Inari, with its shrine-like torii gate but Buddhist temple essence, stood at a crossroads of existence. However, the power of faith, deeply rooted in the lives of the people for centuries, was stronger than the policy. Countless worshippers earnestly petitioned for Saijo Inari's survival. In response to their fervent desire, the government specially permitted it to maintain its 'Shinbutsu-konkō (神仏混淆)' (syncretic) form. This was a highly exceptional measure at the time, and thanks to it, we can still witness the mystical sanctuary where a shrine and a temple blend into one space today.

As such, Saijo Inari is more than just a religious facility; it is a living testament to popular faith that has overcome a miraculous founding myth and a turbulent history.

### 2. 境内 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Sights and Power Spots

The precincts of Saijo Inari are a harmonious blend of sacred energy and historical architecture, offering new impressions with every step. We invite you to walk the path of worship and deeply feel its mystical charm.

#### **【Main Hall (本殿) & Hall of Worship (拝殿)】**

The towering **'Reikō-den (霊光殿)'** at the center of the precincts is a massive wooden structure that serves as both the main hall and the hall of worship. Completed in 1979, this building incorporates elements of Indian temple architecture, creating a grand and exotic atmosphere that is quite different from traditional Japanese temples. The curves of the enormous roof and the intricate carvings overwhelm the viewer, making one feel the weight of the divinity that resides here.

Worshippers offer their prayers with a reverent heart in front of the Reikō-den. The worship etiquette here is slightly different from that of a typical shrine. Instead of the Shinto practice of 'ni-hai ni-hakushu ippai (二拝二拍手一拝)' (two bows, two claps, one bow), it is common to **quietly place one's hands together in the Buddhist style and make a wish in one's heart**. The thick incense smoke rising from the giant incense burner creates a sacred atmosphere, as if carrying the worshippers' wishes to the heavens. It is also said that exposing an ailing part of your body to this smoke can have a healing effect.

#### **【Symbolic Torii and Structures】**

- **Grand Torii (大鳥居)**: Upon arriving at Saijo Inari, the first thing that greets visitors is a massive torii gate that seems to pierce the sky. Standing 27.5 meters tall with pillars 3.6 meters in circumference, this steel torii is one of the largest in Japan. The sight of a torii, which originally symbolizes the entrance to a Shinto shrine, standing before a Buddhist temple is the most symbolic landscape of Saijo Inari's Shinbutsu-shūgō. As we pass through this grand gate, we feel with our whole being that we are crossing the boundary between the secular world and sacred space.

- **Niōmon Gate (仁王門)**: After passing through the Grand Torii and walking up the approach, the massive Niōmon Gate appears. On either side of the gate stand the muscular Kongo Rikishi statues, 'Agyō (阿形)' with its mouth open and 'Ungyō (吽形)' with its mouth closed, protecting the Buddhist law. These fearsome-looking guardians prevent evil spirits from entering the precincts. As you pass through the Niōmon Gate, try to cast away worldly desires and distractions to approach your worship with a pious heart.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Old Main Hall (旧本殿)**: Behind the current Reikō-den, a little further up, lies the tranquil Old Main Hall. This was the former main hall built in the Meiji era, and the traces of its long history give it an even deeper sense of sanctity. Today, it is known as a power spot where strong energy gathers, and many people come here to offer quiet prayers to receive its special aura. It is a perfect place for introspection in a calm and peaceful atmosphere, different from the splendor of the Reikō-den.

- **En-no-kiri Massha (縁の末社)**: This is a special place famous for its blessings related to making and breaking connections. Enshrined here together are a god of **'en-musubi (縁結び, tying good relationships)'** and a god of **'en-kiri (縁切り, cutting bad relationships)'**. The worship method is unique: first, you pray to both deities. Then, you receive an envelope containing red and white threads. With a wish to sever bad ties, you tie the white thread, and with a wish to form good connections, you tie the red thread in the designated place. It is a sacred space that offers comfort and the courage for a new beginning to those troubled by complex human relationships.

- **Hachijō-iwa (八畳岩)**: This is a giant rock that you can find deep within the precincts by following a mountain path. Its name, meaning "Eight-Tatami-Mat Rock," comes from its surface being as large as eight tatami mats. Legend says this is where the founder, Hōon Daishi, practiced asceticism, and it remains a powerful spiritual spot favored by practitioners and those seeking deep meditation. If you place your hand on the rock and close your eyes, you may have a mystical experience of feeling the energy of ancient nature and the ascetic's spirit.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Proof of Your Visit

A visit to Saijo Inari doesn't end with just a prayer. The goshuin and other sacred items (like omamori), which serve as a proof of your connection with the deity and allow you to bring its blessings into your daily life, are another joy of the pilgrimage.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Saijo Inari clearly shows its identity. Unlike the goshuin of a typical shrine where the shrine's name is written, the center of the goshuin here is boldly brushed with the characters for **'Saijoikyo-o Daibosatsu (最上位経王大菩薩)'**. This is clear evidence that this place enshrines a Buddhist figure.

The calligraphy is elegant yet powerful, seemingly expressing both the dignity and compassion of the Daibosatsu. Above the central characters, a Bonji (梵字, a Sanskrit character) is stamped, adding to the Buddhist flavor, while the vermilion seal 'Bizen-no-kuni Saijō Inariyama (備前國 最上稲荷山)' certifies its history and location. For goshuin collectors, this unique goshuin, imbued with the history of Shinbutsu-shūgō, is a must-have. Limited edition goshuin with special designs may be available during certain periods, so it is recommended to check the official website before your visit.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

The amulet office at Saijo Inari is filled with various omamori (amulets) and engimono (lucky charms) for different wishes. Here are a few that particularly stand out.

- **Yūzū Inari (ゆずう稲荷) Omamori**: 'Yūzū (融通)' means 'to go smoothly' or 'to be flexible,' and this charm is especially for praying that financial matters will be resolved smoothly. A small, cute fox-shaped ceramic contains a paper fortune slip, making it popular not only for its blessings but also as a souvenir of the visit. It's the perfect gift for business owners or anyone wishing to improve their financial luck.

- **En-musubi (縁結び) Omamori**: This amulet is related to the 'En-no-kiri' spot mentioned earlier. It features a beautiful design with a red and white thread motif and is said to have the power to attract good relationships and strengthen existing ones. It is recommended for those hoping for new encounters or wishing to cherish their relationship with a partner.

- **Health and Longevity (健康長寿) Omamori**: A unique amulet that unfolds like a folding screen (byōbu). Just as a screen blocks ill winds, this charm is meant to ward off all diseases and misfortunes, ensuring a long, healthy, and peaceful life. It is an excellent gift for wishing for the health of parents or other loved ones.
