Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' traveling to beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a fantastical shrine in the deep mountains of Saga Prefecture, Kyushu, that seems to be floating in the sky. It is a place whose splendor rivals that of Nikko Toshogu, earning it the name **'Nikko of the West (Chinzei Nikko)'**—the **'Yutoku Inari Shrine (祐徳稲荷神社)'**.

The massive main hall, built with red lacquer on a steep cliff, delivers an overwhelming sense of awe the moment you see it. As one of Japan's three great Inari shrines, it is also a sacred power spot, constantly visited by people praying for business prosperity and family safety.

Shall we journey together to Yutoku Inari Shrine, the red jewel of Saga, and encounter the celestial scenery and heart-stirring mythological tales that await beyond the red torii tunnel?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Miracle Built from a Woman's Prayer

Behind the splendor of Yutoku Inari Shrine lies the deep faith of one woman.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Guardians of Food, Clothing, and Shelter】**

This shrine enshrines three deities: **Ukanomitama-no-Okami (god of grains)**, **Omiyanome-no-Okami (goddess of arts)**, and **Sarutahiko-no-Okami (god of guidance)**.
As they are gods who enrich our lives, help talents blossom, and illuminate our paths, they bestow blessings across all aspects of life, including **business prosperity**, **family safety**, **traffic safety**, and **improvement in artistic skills**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legacy of Princess Manko】**

In 1687, during the early Edo period, **Princess Manko**, the wife of the lord of the Hizen Kashima domain, brought a divided spirit of the Inari deity enshrined in the Kyoto Imperial Palace when she married into the family.
She spent her life praying here for the well-being of the people and vowed to become a deity to help them even after her death. The shrine's name was derived from her posthumous title, 'Yutoku-in (祐徳院)'. The unique architectural style, built on a cliff, is reminiscent of Kiyomizu-dera in Kyoto.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Red Path to the Sky

The shrine grounds are three-dimensionally arranged along the mountainside, making it a joy to walk through.

#### **Main Hall on the Cliff (Kakezukuri)**

The **'Kakezukuri'** style, where tall pillars support the main hall, is the symbol of Yutoku Inari Shrine. The combination of red lacquer and ornate decorations boasts a dazzling beauty. (An elevator is available, so anyone can easily access it!)

#### **Red Torii Tunnel and Okunoin**

A mountain path next to the main hall is lined with an endless series of red torii gates. Following this mystical tunnel to the mountain's summit leads to the **'Okunoin (Inner Shrine)'**. The panoramic view of the Ariake Sea and Kashima City from here is incredibly refreshing. It's a moment where you feel the climb was truly worthwhile.

#### **Iwasaki Shrine (Matchmaking)**

By the pond below the main hall is the Iwasaki Shrine, famous for **'matchmaking (enmusubi)'**. Write your wish for love on a heart-shaped ema (votive plaque).

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Luck Brought by a Horse

The **'seasonal limited goshuin'**, which features a powerful calligraphy style accompanied by different flower illustrations for each season (cherry blossoms, hydrangeas, autumn leaves, etc.), is very popular. It looks like a piece of art.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Horseshoe Charm (Mamusubi)**: A horseshoe-shaped charm signifying that "everything will go well (umaku iku)." It's the perfect gift to bring good fortune.
