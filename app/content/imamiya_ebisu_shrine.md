### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Ebisu-sama, the Bundle of Joy from Across the Sea

Before passing through the shrine's red torii gate, shall we first learn about its master, Ebisu-sama?

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto (Ebisu)】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto**, also known as **Ebisu-sama**.
Yes, it's him—the one with a fishing rod in his right hand and a large sea bream in his left, beaming with a wide smile. Originally the god of fishing prayed to for a bountiful catch, in commercially developed Osaka, he is more famous as the **'God of Business'** and the **'God of Wealth'**.
Although other prominent deities like Amaterasu (the sun goddess) and Susanoo (averter of calamities) are also enshrined, the main star here is undoubtedly the friendly Ebisu-sama.

#### **【Origins and History: Prince Shotoku's Guardian Deity】**

The shrine's history dates back a remarkable 1,400 years to the era of Prince Shotoku. When Prince Shotoku was building Shitennoji Temple, he established Imamiya Ebisu Shrine to protect the western direction. At that time, this area was coastal, close to fish markets, and bustling with maritime trade. Naturally, the god of fishing came to be worshipped, and as merchants from the market gradually gathered, it became a center for commercial prosperity.

The **'Toka Ebisu'** festival, which began in the Edo period, has become a source of pride and identity for Osaka's merchants. The famous slogan, "Bring your bamboo branch (sasa) for a thriving business!" still heats up January in Osaka.

### 2. 🏮 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Strike the Gong and Shout Your Wish

The shrine grounds are modest in size but filled with the fervent wishes of Osaka's merchants. Here are the special worship spots you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Majestic Haiden and its Unique Roof**

The front *haiden* (hall of worship) is both magnificent and ornate. Behind it, the *honden* (main hall) has an impressive bronze roof, which seems to symbolize the resilience of Osaka, having been rebuilt after its destruction in the war. Here, you should offer your prayers respectfully with the "two bows, two claps, one bow" method.

#### **★Key Point: The Dora (Gong) Behind the Main Hall**

Don't just leave after praying at the *haiden*! **Go around to the back of the main hall.** There, you'll find two large **dora (gongs)** hanging.
According to legend, Ebisu-sama is a bit hard of hearing. Therefore, there's a fun belief that after praying at the front, you must go to the back, strike these gongs **'Bang! Bang!'** and shout your wish loudly once more to make sure he hears you.
Try striking it vigorously while saying, "Ebessan! Don't forget my wish! Please grant it!" It's incredibly satisfying.

#### **Daikokusha, Enshrining Okuninushi**

Within the grounds, there is also a sub-shrine dedicated to **Daikokuten (Okuninushi)**, who is Ebisu's father and another god of fortune. If you pay respects to both the father (Daikoku, for wealth) and the son (Ebisu, for business), your financial luck is practically guaranteed, right?

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: The Bamboo Branch that Beckons Fortune

The amulets and souvenirs at Imamiya Ebisu Shrine are the definition of splendid.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here features the bold and powerful calligraphy for **'今宮戎神社 (Imamiya Ebisu Shrine)'** and a stamp with the **sea bream** design, Ebisu-sama's symbol. During the Toka Ebisu period in January, you can get a special limited-edition goshuin with gold accents, so be sure to check it out.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (Lucky Charms)】**

- **Fukuzasa (Lucky Bamboo Branch)**: The symbol of the Toka Ebisu festival! You receive a green bamboo branch (for free) and then purchase various auspicious ornaments (**kitcho**), such as sea bream, rice bales, and gold coins, to attach to it. It is said that hanging the lavishly decorated fukuzasa at home will bring good fortune throughout the year.
- **Kumade (Lucky Rake)**: A colorful decorative rake meant to 'rake in' money and luck. It's a perfect gift for a new business opening.
- **Ebisu Amulet**: A financial luck amulet in a yellow or gold pouch, perfect for keeping in your wallet.
