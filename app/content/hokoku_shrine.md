### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Hero Who Seized the Realm with His Bare Hands

The energy of Hokoku Shrine is the very essence of its protagonist, Hideyoshi.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Toyotomi Hideyoshi】**

The main deity (主神, shushin) here is **Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Hokoku Daimyojin)**.
He is a legendary figure who started as Oda Nobunaga's sandal-bearer and rose to the position of Kampaku (equivalent to a prime minister). Thanks to his life of making the impossible possible, he is revered here as a god of **'career success'**, **'good fortune'**, and **'business prosperity'**.
His son, Hideyori, and his younger brother, Hidenaga, who are enshrined alongside him, are also seen as steadfast supporters protecting the family's prosperity.

#### **【Origins and History: A Drama of Destruction and Revival】**

After Hideyoshi's death, the original Hokoku Shrine, splendidly built in Kyoto, was completely destroyed by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was a dark age when even his name was taboo.
However, 250 years later, he was revived with the Meiji Restoration. The shrine was rebuilt in Nakanoshima, Osaka in 1879, and in 1961, it was moved inside Osaka Castle, the very place where he poured his lifelong dreams. The shrine's history of overcoming the storms of time and rising again is itself a symbol of **'revival'** and **'comeback'**.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Gates and Statues that Beckon Success

The grounds are compact but filled with a powerful energy. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Gourd (Hyotan), a Symbol of Success**

You can see gourd motifs throughout the grounds. This is due to the legend of the **'Sennari Hyotan' (Thousand Gourds)**, where Hideyoshi would add a gourd to his banner after each victory in battle. The gourd is a direct symbol of victory and success.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**
