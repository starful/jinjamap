Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to **'Aso Shrine (阿蘇神社)'**, nestled within the embrace of Mt. Aso, the great caldera volcano in the "Land of Fire," Kumamoto. Having protected this land for over 2,500 years, this is where the history of the Aso region's pioneering began and a sacred place where countless prayers have accumulated.

Although it suffered great damage from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, Aso Shrine is regaining its majestic form amidst the hopes of the people. I hope you will feel a special kind of inspiration here, a place where the tenacious power of a god who tamed wild nature coexists with the human hope of overcoming disaster.

Shall we embark on this journey together, all the way to the mystical Monzen-machi street where the clear spring water of Aso flows?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Pioneering God Who Turned a Lake into Fertile Land

Behind the grandeur of Aso Shrine lies a heroic myth of taming immense nature.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Takeiwatatsu-no-Mikoto】**

The main deity (主祭神) here is **Takeiwatatsu-no-Mikoto**, the grandson of Japan's first emperor.
As his name, meaning 'strong as a rock and powerful as a dragon,' suggests, he was the hero who pioneered the Aso region. According to legend, he drained the water from the Aso caldera, which was originally a giant lake, and turned it into fertile land where people could live.
For this reason, he is revered as the **'God of Pioneering'** and the **'God of Agriculture'**, and has become a steadfast guardian deity who watches over **business prosperity**, **new beginnings**, and **family safety**.

#### **【Origins and History: 2,500 Years Beyond Disaster】**

Aso Shrine is an ancient shrine (古社) of profound history, said to have been founded in 281 BC. As the 'Ichinomiya (first-ranked shrine)' of Higo Province (Kumamoto), it has served as the spiritual pillar of the region for 2,500 years.
It experienced the tragedy of its National Treasure-class Romon gate and worship hall collapsing in the 2016 earthquake. However, restoration work is underway with nationwide support, and the process itself has become a symbol of 'revival' and 'hope.' (The Romon gate was completely restored in 2023!)

### 2. ⛰️ A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Wish-Granting Stone and a Mystical Pine Tree

Aso Shrine has unique points of worship hidden within its grounds. Don't miss a single one!

#### **Yokosando and the Majestic Romon Gate**

Unlike most shrines where the main path leads directly to the main hall, Aso Shrine's approach is a **'Yokosando'**, which runs alongside the main hall. The massive Romon gate (樓門) boasts an overwhelming presence, considered one of the three great Romon gates of Japan. Feel its resilient energy as you stand before the gate that has overcome the earthquake.

#### **Takasago-no-Matsu (The Pine of Marriage)**

Beside the worship hall stands a pine tree called **'Takasago-no-Matsu'**. It is said that walking around this tree will lead you to a good partner.

- **Men**: Walk two circles to the left.
- **Women**: Walk two circles to the right.
  Take a slow walk around it while making a wish.

#### **Negaikakeishi (Wish-Granting Stone)**

This mystical stone within the precincts is the **'Wish-Granting Stone'**. It is believed that if you state your wish three times in your heart and then stroke the stone three times, your wish will come true. You can feel the earnest desires of countless people from the stone's smooth, polished surface.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Charms to Fulfill Your Dreams

Many of the items available at Aso Shrine are meant to give hope and courage.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin from Aso Shrine is full of power. The bold calligraphy of **'阿蘇神社 (Aso Shrine)'** and the **'肥後一宮 (Higo Ichinomiya)'** seal feel like a powerful talisman in itself. There are also special Goshuin available to support the earthquake restoration, making for a meaningful souvenir.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yumekanai (Dream-Fulfilling) Amulet**: This amulet, embroidered with the character '夢' (dream), provides great strength to those striving towards a goal.
- **Enmusubi Amulet**: A matchmaking amulet imbued with the legend of the pine tree. Its lovely design is popular.
- **Obimori (Safe Childbirth Amulet)**: Aso Shrine has long been famous as a place to pray for safe childbirth.

### 4. 💧 Nearby Attractions: Monzen-machi, Where Clear Water Flows

In front of the shrine, a charming shopping street unfolds. The main attraction here is **'water'**.

#### **1. Mizuki (Water Source) Tour**

- **Features**: Throughout the shopping street, there are **'Mizuki (water spots)'** where clear spring water gushes out. Each has a different name, such as 'Water of Learning' or 'Water of Financial Luck,' so enjoy a stroll while comparing the tastes of the water. It's a good idea to bring a tumbler!

#### **2. Akaushi (Red Cow) Gourmet**

- **Recommendation**: Be sure to try Aso's specialty, **'Akaushi-don'** (red cow rice bowl) or **'Akaushi croquettes'**. The beef, which is low in fat, light, and full of juicy flavor, will give you an unforgettable taste experience.

#### **3. Mt. Aso Nakadake Crater**

- **Access**: 30 minutes by car.
- **Features**: This is the active volcano that serves as the backdrop for the myths. Witness the awe of nature as you gaze upon the bubbling, emerald-green caldera lake. (Access may be restricted depending on volcanic activity.)
