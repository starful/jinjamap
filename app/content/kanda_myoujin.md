Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a place where Tokyo's past and present meet in the most dramatic way. Right next to the dazzling neon signs of Akihabara, known as the 'holy land of otaku,' is a place where a guardian deity has watched over Tokyo (Edo) for 1300 long years. This is **'Kanda Myoujin (神田明神)'.**

This is a powerful 'power spot' that enshrines 'Masakado,' one of the most powerful vengeful spirits and a god of victory in Japanese history, and 'Daikokuten,' the god of wealth. But surprisingly, you can also find an **'IT charm'** to protect your computers and smartphones, and it's filled with merchandise from collaborations with famous anime.

A unique charm where tradition and subculture coexist, and a powerful energy that brings success and victory. Shall we open the red gates of Kanda Myoujin and step into its mystical world together?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origin: The Guardian of Competitors and Merchants

The powerful energy of Kanda Myoujin comes from the deities enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Victory, Wealth, Prosperity】**

Three deities are enshrined here.

- **Daikokuten (Oonamuchi-no-mikoto)**: The god of abundance and wealth. He helps with **matchmaking** and **business prosperity**.
- **Ebisu (Sukunahikona-no-mikoto)**: The god of fishing and commerce, he oversees **thriving business** and **kaiun (opening up good fortune)**.
- **Masakado (Taira no Masakado)**: A tragic hero and a powerful warrior. With his indomitable spirit that never yields to adversity, he is in charge of **'luck in competitions (kach-iun)'** and **'warding off evil.'**

#### **【Origin and History: The Guardian of All Edo】**

Founded in 730, Kanda Myoujin has a deep connection with Tokugawa Ieyasu. Before the pivotal Battle of Sekigahara, a once-in-a-lifetime challenge, Ieyasu prayed for victory here and went on to achieve a miraculous win, unifying the country.
Afterward, Ieyasu designated Kanda Myoujin as the **'Edo Sochinju (guardian of all Edo)'** and moved it to its current location to protect the *kimon* (unlucky direction) of Edo Castle, enshrining it with great reverence. Even today, it is the first place that Tokyo's business people and office workers visit on their first workday of the new year.

### 2. ⛩️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Ornate Architecture and a Giant Stone Statue

As you enter the shrine grounds, the vibrant vermilion buildings will capture your attention. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Zuishinmon Gate and Goshaden**

The two-story gate at the entrance, **'Zuishinmon,'** stands out with its intricate carvings and brilliant colors. Past the gate, the magnificent **'Goshaden (Main Hall)'** appears. It was rebuilt in 1934 with steel-reinforced concrete and is a robust structure that even withstood the Great Tokyo Air Raid.

#### **Japan's Largest Stone Statue of Daikokuten**

On the left side of the grounds stands a giant stone statue of **Daikokuten** with a benevolent smile. At 6.6 meters tall and weighing 30 tons, it is one of the largest stone statues in Japan. Pray for wealth and good relationships in front of it.

#### **Cultural Exchange Hall EDOCCO**
