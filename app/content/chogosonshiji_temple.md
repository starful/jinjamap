Hello, readers! This is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a rugged mountain deep in the western edge of Nara Prefecture, on the border with Osaka. This is a place where a legend that changed the course of Japanese history 1,400 years ago is still alive: **Chogosonshiji Temple (朝護孫子寺) on Mount Shigi (信貴山)**.

This place is famous among the Japanese as the **'Tiger Temple.'** Right from the entrance, a giant tiger stands imposingly to welcome visitors, and the temple grounds are filled with tiger statues. This is no mere zoo. This is the sacred site where **'Bishamonten' (毘沙門天)**, the god of war and wealth, first appeared in Japan, and the historical spot where Prince Shotoku achieved a miraculous victory.

It is a place earnestly sought by entrepreneurs dreaming of success, students facing important exams, and everyone wishing for financial luck. Shall we journey together to Mount Shigi, a place overflowing with the powerful energy of victory?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The God of Victory Who Appeared in the Hour of the Tiger

Why a tiger, of all things? The answer lies in a mystical legend from 1,400 years ago.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Bishamonten, God of Victory and Wealth】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Bishamonten-ō (毘沙門天王)**, one of the Four Heavenly Kings in Buddhism who protects the north.
As a dignified martial god (武神) clad in armor and holding a spear, he symbolizes the immense power to defeat evil spirits and protect the nation. At the same time, as a member of the 'Seven Lucky Gods,' he is also a deity who brings vast wealth and fortune. Therefore, this place is renowned throughout Japan as a top power spot for **prayers for certain victory (必勝祈願)**, **business prosperity**, and **increased financial luck**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Miracle of Prince Shotoku】**

The time was the late 6th century, when a fierce civil war was being waged between the pro-Buddhist faction (the Soga clan) and the anti-Buddhist faction (the Mononobe clan) over the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. The young **Prince Shotoku**, a proponent of Buddhism, was forced to retreat to this mountain due to an unfavorable turn in the war. In a moment of dire crisis, the prince carved statues of the Four Heavenly Kings from wood and prayed earnestly for victory.

Just then, Bishamonten-ō appeared in the heavens and bestowed upon the prince the secret to certain victory. Remarkably, that moment was the **Year of the Tiger (寅年), the Day of the Tiger (寅の日), and the Hour of the Tiger (寅の刻)**.
Blessed with Bishamonten's divine protection, the prince successfully turned the tide of the battle and won the war, allowing Buddhism to flourish in Japan thereafter. In gratitude, the prince built a temple here and named it **'Mount Shigi' (信貴山)**, meaning 'the mountain to be believed in and relied upon.' Later, after the temple was credited with curing Emperor Daigo's illness, it was granted the temple name **'Chogosonshiji' (朝護孫子寺)**, meaning 'the temple that protects the nation and its descendants like the morning sun.'

Because of this legend, the tiger is considered the messenger of Bishamonten and has become the symbol of Mount Shigi.

### 2. 🐯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Feel the Tiger's Energy

Mount Shigi, where the entire mountain is a vast temple complex, is full of things to see. Comfortable shoes are a must!

#### **The World's Largest Papier-Mâché Tiger (張子の虎)**

At the temple entrance, after crossing a red bridge, an overwhelmingly large tiger appears. It is the **'World's Number One Good Fortune Tiger (Hariko no Tora).**' This giant tiger, traditionally made of papier-mâché (though this one is now reinforced plastic), is characterized by its head that nods up and down. It is said that taking a picture with the tiger will ward off evil and bring in good fortune, so a proof shot is essential.

#### **Main Hall (本堂) and Kaidan-meguri (戒壇巡り)**

Climbing the steep stairs to the Main Hall, built on a cliff, you are greeted with a spectacular, open view overlooking the Yamato Plain. It is a magnificent structure built in the same 'butai' (stage) style as Kiyomizu-dera in Kyoto.
Beneath the Main Hall, there is a special experience called **'Kaidan-meguri' (戒壇巡り)**, or 'ordination platform pilgrimage'. It is a spiritual practice where you walk through complete darkness, guiding yourself by touching the wall. It is believed that if you touch the iron padlock in the dark, you will form a bond with Bishamonten and your wishes will come true. The moment you emerge from the pitch-black darkness back into the light, you can feel as if you've been reborn.

#### **Hidden Power Spots**

- **The Money-Gathering Tiger of Senju-in (千手院)**: At Senju-in, located on the way to the Main Hall, there is a tiger statue holding money in its mouth. It is polished smooth by the hands of people praying for wealth.
- **Kuhachi-dō (空鉢堂)**: This hall is located at the summit of Mount Shigi (437m above sea level). Although it's about a 20-minute hike up a mountain path from the Main Hall, there is a legend that 'at least one wish' made here will be granted. It is also the setting for the legend of the 'flying alms bowl,' where a rock that rolled down the mountain was sent flying back up by divine power.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Souvenirs: Take a Tiger Home

The souvenirs at Mount Shigi are all about tigers. Take their powerful energy home with you.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive different goshuin not only at the Main Hall but also at the various sub-temples (tatchu) on the grounds, such as Senju-in, Gyokuzo-in, and Jogo-in. The goshuin from the Main Hall, with '毘沙門天王 (Bishamonten-ō)' written in bold calligraphy, is full of power.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Hariko no Tora (Papier-Mâché Tiger) Figurine**: This is a cute, smaller version of the large tiger at the entrance. Its nodding head is charming, and it makes for a perfect decoration to ward off bad luck at home. They come in various sizes.
- **Financial Luck Tiger Charm**: This charm, embroidered with a golden tiger, is rumored to attract money if you keep it in your wallet.
- **Victory Charm**: A great gift for those facing exams or competitions.
