title: 'The Mountain of Birth, Death, and Rebirth: The Dewa Sanzan Pilgrimage in Yamagata
  and the Miracle of 2,446 Stone Steps'
---

Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a place deep in the mountains of Yamagata Prefecture in Japan's Tohoku region, a place flowing with mystical spiritual energy: the **'Dewa Sanzan (出羽三山)'**.
This is a vast sacred site encompassing three mountains: Mt. Haguro (present), Mt. Gassan (past), and Mt. Yudono (future). Since ancient times, a pilgrimage here has been called a **'journey of rebirth,'** regarded as a process of cleansing the soul and gaining new life energy.

From the thousand-year-old cedar path praised by the Michelin Green Guide to the noble form of the National Treasure Five-Storied Pagoda and the essence of mountain vegetable cuisine. Shall we walk this special pilgrimage route that heals both body and soul together?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Mystery of the Three Worlds Dwelling in the Mountains

The Dewa Sanzan each govern a different time, embracing our entire lives.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Gods of the Past, Present, and Future】**

- **Mt. Haguro (Present)**: Enshrines Ideha-no-kami. It is the mountain of **'worldly benefits'**, for praying for happiness and wish fulfillment in the here and now.
- **Mt. Gassan (Past)**: Enshrines Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto (the moon god). It is a pure land where the souls of the dead reside, for praying for the peace of ancestors and **'posthumous tranquility'**.
- **Mt. Yudono (Future)**: Enshrines various gods including Oyamatsumi, but its core is a giant rock from which hot spring water gushes. It symbolizes the birth of life and **'rebirth (resurrection)'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Land of Enlightenment Discovered by a Prince】**

1,400 years ago, Prince Hachiko, who fled after losing his father, arrived at Mt. Haguro guided by a three-legged crow (Yatagarasu). After arduous training, he perceived the gods of the three mountains and founded the Dewa Sanzan.
Since then, this place has become the center of **'Shugendo' (mountain asceticism)**, a practice of attaining enlightenment through training in nature, and the white robes of countless ascetics (yamabushi) have covered the mountains.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The 2,446 Steps, a Path of Training and Healing

Mt. Haguro is the only one of the three mountains open for worship year-round and serves as the starting point for the Dewa Sanzan pilgrimage.

#### **Zuishinmon Gate and the Cedar-Lined Path (Suginamiki)**

Passing through the 'Zuishinmon' gate, the entrance to the sacred precincts, a cedar-lined avenue awarded three Michelin stars unfolds. The deep shade and refreshing air created by giant cedar trees over 350 years old make you feel as if your soul is being purified just by walking.

#### **The National Treasure Five-Storied Pagoda and Jijisugi**

Midway along the forest path, you will encounter the **National Treasure Five-Storied Pagoda**, standing elegantly next to the 1,000-year-old 'Grandfather Cedar' (Jijisugi). This wooden pagoda, built by fitting wood together without a single nail, boasts a serene beauty as if it were one with nature.

#### **The 2,446 Stone Steps**

Past the five-storied pagoda begins the true path of asceticism: 2,446 stone steps. Though you may feel out of breath, think of it as letting go of one worldly care with each step you climb. Don't miss the fun of searching for the 33 carvings hidden on the steps!

#### **Sanjin Gosaiden at the Summit**

At the end of the steps, at the summit, the **'Sanjin Gosaiden'** reveals its majesty with a massive thatched roof 2.1 meters thick. It is where the deities of Mt. Gassan and Mt. Yudono, which are inaccessible due to heavy snow in winter, are enshrined together. It is said that worshipping here brings the same merit as visiting all three mountains.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Charms of Rebirth

The amulets of Dewa Sanzan contain the power of 'rebirth' and 'guidance'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive the goshuin for all three mountains at the summit of Mt. Haguro. The powerfully brushed calligraphy of **'出羽三山神社' (Dewa Sanzan Jinja)** is a gratifying symbol of completing the pilgrimage. (During the summer when Mt. Gassan and Mt. Yudono are open, it is recommended to receive them directly at the summit of each mountain!)

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Rebirth Amulet (Umarekawari Mamori)**: The essence of the Dewa Sanzan pilgrimage! It is the perfect gift for those who wish to cast off old energies and start anew.
- **Yatagarasu Amulet**: A guiding crow charm to help you stay on course and move toward your goals. Excellent for travelers and students.
- **Crow Bell**: A bell with a clear sound that wards off evil spirits.
