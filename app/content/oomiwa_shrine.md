title: 'The Sacred Mountain God: Discovering the Origins of Japanese Faith at Nara''s
  Omiwa Shrine'
---

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, we travel to the deepest and oldest roots of faith in Japan's ancient capital, Nara. A short distance from Nara Park, where deer roam freely, lies the city of Sakurai, home to a very special shrine that does not enshrine its god within a building. This is **'Omiwa Shrine (大神神社)'**.

There is no main hall (Honden) here. This is because the towering **Mount Miwa (三輪山)** behind it is the god itself. It's a place where the spirit of ancient people who worshiped nature itself remains intact. From the mysterious spring water said to cure all illnesses to the offerings of eggs beloved by the snake god, Omiwa Shrine is filled with timeless mystery. Let us guide you there.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Mount Miwa, the Abode of the God

The mystique of Omiwa Shrine begins with its origins.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ōmononushi-no-Ōkami】**

The master of this place is **Ōmononushi-no-Ōkami**. Meaning 'Great Master of All Things,' he is a god of civilization who created the country and taught agriculture, medicine, and sake brewing.
Legend has it that he appears in the form of a snake, which is why people revere the **snake** as the god's messenger. You will easily spot offerings of eggs and sake, favorites of the snake, throughout the shrine grounds. He is revered as the god of **business prosperity**, **healing from illness**, **warding off evil**, and **sake (brewing)**, making this a sacred site for brewers nationwide.

#### **【Origins and History: The Shrine Without a Main Hall】**

Omiwa Shrine is one of the oldest shrines in Japan. According to mythology, the god revealed, "Enshrine me on the eastern mountain of Yamato (Mount Miwa)," and so the mountain itself came to be worshiped as the Shintai (御神体, object of worship).
Therefore, instead of constructing an artificial main hall, prayers are offered only through the **Haiden (拝殿, Hall of Worship)**, which faces the mountain, and the unique **'Mitsutorii (三ツ鳥居, Triple Torii Gate)'**. This is a precious example of a preserved primitive form of worship.

### 2. ⛰️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Facing the Sacred Mountain

From the moment you step onto the grounds, you can feel a change in the air. Take a walk along the path filled with a sacred atmosphere and lush forests.

#### **Haiden and Mitsutorii**

Passing through the giant torii gate and walking up the approach, the magnificent Haiden appears. Here, you bow twice, clap twice, and bow once towards Mount Miwa. Behind the Haiden, in a forbidden area (Kinsokuchi), lies the mystical **'Mitsutorii'**, a sacred gate that can only be seen during special rituals or by special application.

#### **The Cure-all Spring, Sai Shrine (狭井神社)**

To the left of the Haiden, along the 'Path of Medicine' (Kusuri-michi), you'll find **'Sai Shrine'**, which enshrines a god of healing. Here, medicinal water called **'Goshinsui (ご神水, sacred water)'** springs forth.
Thanks to the legend that "drinking this water cures any illness," it is bustling with people from all over the country who come to collect it. Purify your body and mind with a cup of this clear, cold water. (Sterilized cups are provided.)

#### **The Stroking Rabbit (Nade-usagi)**

In front of the Sanshuden (assembly hall), there is a cute rabbit statue. It is said that by stroking this rabbit, created due to a mythological connection, the afflicted part of your own body will be healed and your luck will improve. Make a wish as you stroke the rabbit's well-polished head.

#### **Climbing Mount Miwa (Sanshin)**

At Sai Shrine, you can obtain permission to climb Mount Miwa, the sacred mountain body itself. (Round trip: 2-3 hours)
However, this is not just a hike; it is a form of **'worshipful climbing (Tohai)'**. Photography and eating/drinking are prohibited, and one must ascend in a state of meditative silence, fully absorbing the sacred energy. The thrill you feel at the rock altar (Okutsu-iwakura) at the summit will be an unforgettable experience.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: The Blessings of the Snake and Cedar

The amulets and souvenirs of Omiwa Shrine are filled with symbols of nature and mythology.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here is the epitome of simplicity. While it only consists of '大神神社' (Omiwa Jinja) written in bold calligraphy and the seal of the god's alias, **'三輪明神 (Miwa-myōjin)'**, its power feels profound.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Miwa-no-sugi Amulet**: An amulet made from the sacred cedar (sugi) trees of Mount Miwa. It has a faint woody scent and wards off evil.
- **Sugidama Amulet**: An amulet shaped like a Sugidama (a ball of cedar leaves) that is hung in front of sake breweries. Befitting the god of sake, it helps with financial luck and business prosperity.
- **Rabbit Amulet**: Helps to elevate your luck, just like a leaping rabbit.

### ✨ Editor's Closing Remarks

Omiwa Shrine is not a place of flashy attractions. However, the overwhelming power of nature felt when standing before the mountain without a main hall, and the pure faith of people that has continued for over a millennium, brings a deep sense of peace to the heart.

When your body and mind are weary, the clear air of Mount Miwa and its mysterious medicinal water will surely heal you. If you are planning a trip to Nara, I highly recommend a pilgrimage to Omiwa Shrine, the origin point of Japanese faith and a forest of healing.
