Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Hakone (箱根), the nearest hot spring resort from Tokyo, where the majestic Mt. Fuji and a mystical lake create a harmonious landscape. You've probably seen a photo of the red torii gate floating picturesquely on Lake Ashinoko, right? The protagonist of that dreamlike scene is none other than **'Hakone Shrine (箱根神社)'**.

This is more than just a photo spot. It is a place where history breathes, holding the legend of a high priest who subdued a nine-headed poisonous dragon that tormented a village 1,200 years ago, transforming it into a guardian deity. It is also where Minamoto no Yoritomo, founder of Japan's first samurai government, vowed to make a comeback after a defeat.

Hakone Shrine is filled with a powerful aura that brings victory and the blessings of the dragon god that grants love. As you walk along the path lined with dense cedar trees, you will feel your worries fade away and your spirit replenish with clear energy. Now, shall we embark on a journey to this sacred site on the mystical lake?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Three Generations of Gods Who Bring Victory

To understand the depth of Hakone Shrine, one must first hear the dramatic stories of the gods enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Hakone Ōkami】**

This shrine venerates three deities, collectively known as **'Hakone Ōkami (箱根大神)'**.

- **Ninigi-no-Mikoto**: The protagonist of the Tenson Kōrin (descent of the heavenly grandson) myth and an ancestral god of the Imperial family.
- **Konohanasakuya-hime**: The wife of Ninigi-no-Mikoto and the goddess of Mt. Fuji, symbolizing beauty and safe childbirth.
- **Hikohohodemi-no-Mikoto**: The son of the two deities, a god of abundance possessing the energies of both the sea and the mountains.

Because these family gods—grandfather, husband and wife, and son—are enshrined together, the shrine is particularly efficacious for **family safety**, **matchmaking**, and **prosperity of descendants**. Above all, Hakone Shrine has been revered by samurai since ancient times as a god of **'Shōun (勝運, luck in winning)'**.

#### **【Origins and History: Subduing a Dragon and Changing History】**

The beginnings of Hakone Shrine trace back to the Nara period. At that time, a terrifying nine-headed poisonous dragon called 'Kuzuryū' lived in Lake Ashinoko, preying on people. A high priest, Mangan Shōnin, took pity on the situation and, after praying for three days and nights, finally subdued the dragon. The dragon repented and vowed to become the guardian deity of the lake. This is the origin of both Hakone Shrine and Kuzuryu Shrine.

As time passed, at the end of the Heian period, Minamoto no Yoritomo, who was fleeing after a defeat in battle, hid here, saved his life, and pledged his comeback. He eventually unified the country and established the Kamakura shogunate. Afterwards, powerful figures of the time, such as Tokugawa Ieyasu, flocked here to pray for victory, solidifying Hakone Shrine's status as the **'Guardian Shrine of the Kanto Region (関東の総鎮守)'**.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Red Torii and the Thousand-Year Cedar Forest

Worshipping at Hakone Shrine is a process of becoming one with its magnificent nature. Here are the must-see points.

#### **Torii of Peace (平和の鳥居)**

This is the giant red torii gate that appears to float on Lake Ashinoko. It was erected in 1952 to commemorate the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the investiture of the Crown Prince, and as its name suggests, it symbolizes 'peace'. The sight of the torii, enveloped in morning mist or silhouetted against the evening glow, is simply mystical. It's the best spot to capture a photo of a lifetime, but please also remember the message of peace it holds.

#### **The 89 Steps and the Cedar Forest Path**

The path leading from the lakeside to the main shrine is a forest trail where giant cedar trees, some over 800 years old, stand guard. As you climb the 89 stone steps, known as the 'Seisandō', you'll feel clean air seeping deep into your lungs. Halfway up the stairs is the **'Yatate-no-sugi (Arrow-stand Cedar)'**, a sacred tree where warriors offered arrows to pray for victory. It is imbued with a strong energy for wish fulfillment.

#### **Kuzuryū Shrine Shingū (九頭龍神社 新宮)**

Next to the main shrine is the 'Kuzuryū Shrine Shingū'. Since the main Kuzuryū Shrine (Hongū) is located deep in the forest and difficult to access, this branch shrine was built to allow everyone to worship easily.
The **'Ryūjin-sui (Dragon God Water)'** here is particularly popular; it is said that rinsing your mouth with it cleanses impurities, and drinking it improves luck in love and finances. Be sure to collect some water pouring from the dragon-shaped basin.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Capturing the Dragon God's Energy

Here are some of the special items imbued with the unique energy of Hakone Shrine.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Hakone Shrine is powerful and simple. In the center, the characters '箱根神社' are written, along with a stamp that reads **'関東総鎮守 (Kantō Sōchinju)'**, signifying its authority as the Guardian of the Kanto Region. You can also receive the goshuin for the adjacent Kuzuryu Shrine, so try collecting both side by side.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Wagokoro Mamori (Harmony Amulet)**: This amulet features two magatama (curved beads) interlocked to form a single circle. It protects harmony and bonds between lovers, spouses, and friends. Its unique and beautiful design also makes it a great souvenir.
- **Victory Amulet (勝守)**: An amulet imbued with the legend of Yoritomo. It will grant powerful support to those facing exams or important projects.
- **Kuzuryū Amulet**: Enhances financial luck and business fortune with the power of the dragon god.

### 4. 🛳️ Nearby Attractions: A Lake Cruise and the Ambiance of an Old Road

After visiting the shrine, enjoy the romance of Hakone.

#### **1. Lake Ashinoko Sightseeing Cruise (Pirate Ship)**

- **Location**: Motohakone Port (10-minute walk from the shrine).
- **Features**: The view of the Torii of Peace and Mt. Fuji from the lake is a different kind of感動 than seeing it from land. Cruising across the lake on a splendid pirate-ship-themed boat is an exhilarating experience.

#### **2. Amazake Chaya (甘酒茶屋)**

- **Location**: About a 10-minute bus ride.
- **Features**: A traditional teahouse that has served as a rest stop for travelers for 400 years since the Edo period. A warm cup of **'amazake'** (sweet, non-alcoholic fermented rice drink) sipped under the thatched roof while smelling the hearth fire is absolutely delicious. The simple sweetness, derived only from rice without added sugar, is superb.

#### **3. Hakone Checkpoint (箱根関所)**

- **Location**: A 15-minute walk along the lake.
- **Features**: This is a reconstruction of an Edo-period checkpoint. You can step back in time while observing the buildings and scenes of the strict travel inspections of that era.
