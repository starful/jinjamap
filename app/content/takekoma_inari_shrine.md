Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' introducing hidden sacred sites from around the world.

Today, I will guide you to Iwanuma City in Miyagi Prefecture, the gateway to Japan's Tohoku region. Here lies a venerable shrine that has watched over the prosperity of the Tohoku region for over 1,100 years. It is a renowned spot counted among **'Japan's Three Great Inari'** along with Fushimi Inari in Kyoto and Yutoku Inari in Saga—the one and only **'Takekoma Inari Shrine (竹駒稲荷神社)'**.

From the legend that began with an oracle delivered by a white fox, to the profound reverence of the Date Masamune clan, and the fervent energy of countless business people who visit each year to pray for success. As you walk along the mystical approach lined with red torii gates, you will feel an energy of abundance welling up from deep within your heart.

Now, shall we embark on a journey to Takekoma Inari Shrine, where a millennium of history and the legend of the white fox come to life?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Land of Plenty Foretold by a White Fox

The majesty of Takekoma Inari Shrine is evident from its history and origins.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Guardians of Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Industry】**

This shrine enshrines three deities: **Ukanomitama-no-kami (god of food)**, **Ukemochi-no-kami (goddess of food)**, and **Wakumusubi-no-kami (god of life/growth)**.
Together, these three deities govern all aspects that enrich human life, including **bountiful harvests (agriculture)**, **business prosperity (commerce)**, and **industrial development (industry)**. Perhaps for this reason, the shrine constantly attracts a diverse range of people praying for success and stability, from business professionals in suits to farmers.

#### **【Origins and History: An Oracle from a Thousand Years Ago】**

The shrine's history dates back to 842, during the Heian period. When Ono no Takamura was inspecting this region, an old man riding a white fox (an incarnation of the Inari deity) appeared and delivered a prophecy: **"If you enshrine me on this Mt. Takekoma, this land will prosper greatly."** In response, the deity was enshrined here from Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, founding Takekoma Inari Shrine.

It later gained the full support of the Date clan, the lords of Sendai, and established itself as the foremost guardian of commerce in the Tohoku region. Having been steadfastly rebuilt through numerous wars and disasters over the centuries, it has become a symbol of indomitable life force and prosperity.

### 2. 🦊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Feast of White Foxes and Red Torii Gates

Upon entering the grounds, you'll find a harmonious blend of magnificent architecture and a mystical atmosphere. Here are the points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Legacy of the Date Clan, the Romon (楼門)**

The grand two-story gate (Romon) standing at the entrance was originally a gate from Iwanuma Castle, which was relocated here. The red lacquer and intricate carvings exude the authority and historical weight of the Date clan.

#### **The Majestic Haiden and Honden**

Rebuilt in the Edo period style, the Haiden (hall of worship) is both splendid and graceful. Stand before the Haiden, bathed in the morning sun, and offer your prayers for business prosperity and family safety with the "two bows, two claps, one bow" ritual. Deep behind it lies the Honden (main hall), where the deity resides.

#### **The Mystical Resting Place of Foxes, Myobusha (命婦社)**

Next to the Haiden is the **'Myobusha'**, which enshrines the white foxes, the messengers of the deity. The sight of countless stone fox statues lined up is both eerie and sacred. It is said that if you offer fried tofu (aburaage) here while making a wish, the foxes will swiftly deliver your message to the deity.

#### **The Red Tunnel, Senbon Torii and Okumiya**

At the east entrance, you'll find the **'Senbon Torii'**, where red torii gates form a tunnel. Passing through this tunnel of cascading red light leads to the **'Okumiya' (inner shrine)**, the very birthplace of the shrine. Nestled in a quiet forest, the Okumiya is a power spot where the strongest energy is concentrated, so be sure to visit.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Luck Brought by Nine Horses

Here are some special items to help you cherish the memory of your visit.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Takekoma Inari Shrine is characterized by its elegant and powerful calligraphy. The red shrine seal stamped in the center provides a sense of reassurance, much like a talisman itself.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (Good Luck Charms)】**

- **"Umaku Iku" (Things Go Well) Amulet**: This amulet features a drawing of 'nine horses (umaku)'. Through a Japanese pun, it carries the meaning "everything will go well (umaku iku)," making it an incredibly popular souvenir.
- **Victory Amulet (Kachimamori)**: This victory amulet is imbued with the martial luck of the Date clan. It is recommended for those facing important exams or contracts.
