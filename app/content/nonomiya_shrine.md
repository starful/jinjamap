Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to find beautiful sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **Arashiyama (嵐山)** in the west of Kyoto, a place that boasts beauty throughout all four seasons. As you walk through the bamboo grove (Chikurin), where towering bamboo shoots densely pack the sky, you will discover a small, tranquil shrine breathing quietly in the middle of the mystical forest.

This is **'Nonomiya Shrine (野宮神社)'**.
This place is the setting for a tragic love story in Japan's greatest classic novel, "The Tale of Genji," and a sacred site where ancient imperial princesses purified their minds and bodies before departing for Ise Grand Shrine. It is also a place that draws countless visitors, thanks to a mystical turtle rock said to grant wishes within a year if you stroke it.

Our journey back a thousand years, listening to the sound of the wind in the bamboo forest, begins now.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Princess's Prayer and Genji's Love

Nonomiya Shrine may seem small, but the stories it holds are as deep and poignant as a thousand years of history.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): The Sun Goddess and the God of Relationships】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Nonomiya Okami (Amaterasu Omikami)**. She is the sun goddess, the principal deity of Ise Grand Shrine and the ancestral goddess of the Japanese Imperial Family.
The other enshrined deities are also prominent. Gods who grant various wishes, such as **Shirafuku Inari (safe childbirth, business)**, **Daikokuten (matchmaking)**, and **Benzaiten (arts, talent)**, are located throughout the grounds, making it a small yet comprehensive 'wish-granting gift set.' It is particularly famous for its efficacy in **'Enmusubi (matchmaking)'** and **'Kodakara (blessing with children)'**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Stage of The Tale of Genji】**

The history of Nonomiya Shrine is deeply connected to the 'Saio (斎王)' system. In ancient Japan, when an emperor ascended the throne, an unmarried princess was chosen to serve as a priestess at Ise Grand Shrine; she was called the 'Saio.' The chosen princess would stay here at Nonomiya for one year before leaving for Ise to perform purification rituals for her mind and body. It was a sacred yet solitary place where she severed ties with the secular world to prepare herself for dedication to the gods.

The shrine became even more famous because it appears in the 'Sakaki' chapter of **"The Tale of Genji,"** the pinnacle of Japanese literature. Nonomiya is the backdrop for the poignant farewell scene where the protagonist, Hikaru Genji, visits his former lover, Lady Rokujo (Rokujo no Miyasudokoro). The 'black wood torii (Kuroki no Torii)' and the 'brushwood fence' described in the novel still retain their appearance today, welcoming visitors.

### 2. 🎋 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Mystical Space in the Bamboo Forest

As you enter the shrine, breathing in the fresh air of the bamboo forest, you might feel as if you've slipped back into the Heian period.

#### **Kuroki no Torii (黒木の鳥居)**

The torii gate at the shrine's entrance is unlike any other. The **'Kuroki no Torii,'** made from whole, unbarked sawtooth oak logs, represents the oldest style of torii in Japan. Its dark, rustic appearance reflects the ancient people's reverence for natural divinity, eschewing artificiality.

#### **Moss Garden (Jūtan no Koke)**

Upon entering the grounds, you'll be amazed by the green carpet spread beneath your feet. The **moss garden**, resembling a laid-out carpet (jūtan), exudes the atmosphere of Kyoto. After the rain, the damp moss takes on a deeper shade of green, adding to its mystique.

#### **The Wish-Granting Turtle Rock (Okame-ishi)**

The most popular spot at Nonomiya Shrine! To the left of the main hall lies **'Okame-ishi,'** a mysterious stone shaped like a turtle's shell.
There is a legend that says, **"If you make a wish while stroking this stone with all your heart, it will surely come true within a year."** You can see many people lining up to rub the stone and pray earnestly. Be sure to give it a try!
