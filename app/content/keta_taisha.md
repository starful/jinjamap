Hello, fellow travel lovers! This is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' where we introduce hidden gem shrines from all over Japan.

Today, I will guide you to Hakui City in Ishikawa Prefecture, the gateway to the Noto Peninsula (能登半島), which juts out powerfully into the Sea of Japan. Following the coastline battered by rough waves, you will encounter a mystical sanctuary surrounded by a dense forest. This is **Keta Taisha (気多大社)**.

This is not just an ancient shrine. It is the stage of a legend where a hero from Japan's founding myths defeated a giant serpent to bring peace to the land, and it is a spiritual space that houses the forbidden forest 'Irazunomori (入らずの森),' where no one is allowed to set foot. Above all, it is renowned throughout Japan as the ultimate **'Enmusubi (matchmaking)'** sanctuary, where it's said that a visit will surely lead you to a good connection.

Now, shall we open the gates of time and embark on a spiritual pilgrimage with me into the deep forests of Keta Taisha, where 2,000 years of mystery lie dormant?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Mythical Hero Becomes a God of Relationships

Before passing through the shrine's magnificent torii gate, understanding the deity enshrined here and the stories associated with them is the most important key to deepening your journey. At the heart of Keta Taisha resides a very familiar and great god.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Okuninushi-no-Okami】**

The main deity (主祭神) of Keta Taisha is **Okuninushi-no-Okami (大国主大神)**.
Those familiar with Japanese mythology might recall Izumo Taisha in Shimane Prefecture; he is the same deity enshrined there. He is the hero of 'nation-building' (国造り) who ceded control of the terrestrial world to the sun goddess Amaterasu, and he is a benevolent god who governs all aspects that enrich human life, such as agriculture, fishing, medicine, and commerce.

However, among his many powers, the one that shines brightest is undoubtedly **'Enmusubi (縁結び),'** the power to forge connections. The connections mentioned here are not limited to romance between men and women.

- A partner to spend a lifetime with
- A business partner to lead you to success
- A friend to share life's wisdom with
- The perfect job or work for you

Okuninushi-no-Okami presides over all such positive connections in the world. This is precisely why Keta Taisha is worshipped as a powerful spiritual spot not only by young men and women wishing for success in love but also by those dreaming of business prosperity and success.

#### **【Origin and History: The Legend of the Hero Who Defeated a Serpent】**

The founding legend of Keta Taisha is as thrilling as a fantasy movie. A very long time ago, the Noto Peninsula was a rough and barren land. To make matters worse, a giant serpent god (蛇神) appeared, spewing venom and causing storms, tormenting the people.

Hearing the painful cries of the people, Okuninushi-no-Okami led some 300 deities across the Sea of Japan and landed here in Noto. With wisdom and valor, he subdued the evil serpent god, cultivated the desolate land, and helped the people farm in peace.

After completing his task, the god did not return to Izumo but vowed to stay and protect this land forever. The people built a shrine in gratitude and named it **'Keta (気多)'**, meaning **'a place where much (多) energy (気) gathers.'** True to its name, this land became a place overflowing with the energy of life.

Historically, Keta Taisha's status was immense. It was recorded as a Myojin Taisha (名神大社) in the Heian period law code "Engishiki" and was revered as the **'Ichinomiya (一宮)'** of Noto Province (能登国), meaning the number one shrine in the region. During the Edo period, it received full support from the Maeda clan, who ruled the Kaga Domain, and took on its current magnificent form. Keta Taisha is a great tower of faith, built upon the prayers of countless people, from rulers to commoners, over thousands of years.

### 2. 🌲 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Majesty of the Forbidden Forest and National Treasures

Worship at Keta Taisha begins with a walk along a quiet forest path. As you walk while breathing in the phytoncides emitted by the lush cedar and cypress trees, you'll feel the idle thoughts in your mind disappear and your spirit become clear.

#### **Shinmon (神門) and Haiden (拝殿): The Dignity of Important Cultural Properties**

At the end of the main path, the magnificent **Shinmon (神門)** gate greets pilgrims. Built in 1654 by Maeda Mitsutaka, the lord of the Kaga Domain, this gate is designated as a National Important Cultural Property. The moment you pass through it, you feel a sense of reverence, as if you have been cut off from the secular world and entered the realm of the gods.

Beyond the Shinmon, the **Haiden (拝殿)**, or hall of worship, appears. Also an Important Cultural Property, this building is overwhelming not with ornate decorations but with its solemn and grand atmosphere. The thick sacred rope (shimenawa) hanging under the massive roof silently proclaims this is a sacred space. Offer your prayers here with reverence, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette.

#### **Honden (本殿): The Ancient Breath Conveyed by a National Treasure**

Behind the Haiden, in the deepest part of the shrine, lies the **Honden (本殿)**, the sanctuary of the god. Unfortunately, the general public cannot get close, but you can feel its majesty even from a distance. The Honden, rebuilt in 1787, is constructed in the 'Taisha-zukuri' style, one of the oldest forms of Japanese shrine architecture, and is designated as a **National Treasure (國寶)**. You can see the mythological connection in its resemblance to Izumo Taisha, the home of Okuninushi-no-Okami.

#### **Irazunomori (入らずの森): The Forbidden Sanctuary You Must Never Enter**

The highlight of Keta Taisha and its most mystical power spot is the 33,000-square-meter primeval forest stretching behind the Honden: **'Irazunomori (The Forest You Cannot Enter)'.**

This forest is, as its name suggests, a **'sacred precinct (聖域)'**. For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, it has remained untouched by human feet, preserving its primeval appearance. A legendary tale tells that even the chief priest (宮司) of the shrine enters only once a year, blindfolded, for a secret ritual in December.

At the forest entrance, a firmly shut gate and a sacred rope add to its sanctity. Although you cannot enter, stand at the yohaisho (a place for worship from afar) in front of the forest and take a deep breath. You'll feel a thrill as the pure, untainted energy of nature—the cool, clean aura emanating from the forest—penetrates your entire being. This is the source of the powerful 'ki (気)' that Keta Taisha holds.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Shrine Offerings: Tying the Knot of Fate Firmly

Once you've filled yourself with spiritual energy, it's time to take that energy with you. Many of Keta Taisha's shrine offerings have the theme of 'connections.'

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin here is powerful. The phrase **'能登國一宮 (Noto-no-kuni Ichinomiya)'** along with the shrine's name written in bold calligraphy and the vivid red seal serve as an excellent proof of your visit. Receiving the goshuin feels as if you've made an invisible contract with the god, providing a sense of reassurance.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono】**

- **Enmusubi Omamori**: The most popular amulet. This amulet, in a beautiful silk pouch, instills the belief that Okuninushi will bring the right connection to you.
- **Tsuitachi Musubi (ついたち結び)**: A limited-edition prayer tablet available only on the 1st of each month during the 'Tsuitachi Mairi' (first-of-the-month visit). It is said that writing your wish on this wooden tablet, tied with a string whose color changes monthly, will make your wish come true faster. A long line forms from early morning on the 1st of every month.
- **Kokoro Musubi (Heart-Connecting Amulet)**: An amulet made as a pair, so that a couple can each have one. It signifies the binding of their hearts together, making it a perfect gift.
