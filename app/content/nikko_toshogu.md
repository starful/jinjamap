Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover the great heritage sites of the world.

Today, I will guide you to a golden treasure trove hidden within a dense cedar forest in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. This is **'Nikko Toshogu Shrine (日光東照宮)'**, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the pinnacle of Japanese architecture.

This is the sacred place where **Tokugawa Ieyasu**, the unifier of the Warring States period and founder of the Edo Shogunate, is enshrined as a deity. The more than 5,000 ornate carvings and overwhelming gold leaf decorations are breathtaking. But behind this splendor lies the profound will of a hero who dreamt of a peaceful world.

Our special pilgrimage to Nikko Toshogu, where you can receive the wisdom of the 'Sleeping Cat' and the 'Three Wise Monkeys,' as well as powerful luck in competition (勝運), begins now.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: Ieyasu, the Ruler Who Became a God

Everything at Toshogu Shrine begins with Tokugawa Ieyasu.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Tosho Daigongen】**

The main deity (主神) here is **Tosho Daigongen**, which is **Tokugawa Ieyasu**.
Meaning 'The Great Gongen Who Illuminates the East,' the name was given according to his will to protect the peace of Japan even after death. He is worshipped as a powerful deity governing **national tranquility**, **business prosperity**, **success (advancement)**, and **victory**. If you are facing a major life goal, be sure to receive the energy of this place.

#### **【Origin and History: Protecting the Nation as the North Star】**

In 1616, Ieyasu left a will stating, "Build a small shrine on Mount Nikko and enshrine me as a god. I will become the guardian deity of the nation." Nikko is located directly north of Edo (Tokyo), symbolizing his intent to protect the country from a fixed position, like the North Star in Feng Shui.
His grandson, the third shogun Iemitsu, mobilized the best artisans of the era to honor his grandfather, completing the magnificent and ornate Toshogu Shrine we see today.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Precincts: The Pinnacle of Splendor and Hidden Messages

The precincts of Toshogu are like a vast open-air museum. Here are the masterpieces you should not miss.

#### **Sanzaru (The Three Wise Monkeys)**

Under the eaves of the Shinkyusha (Sacred Stable) are the famous carvings of the three monkeys: **'see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.'** They convey the lesson, "Do not see, speak, or hear evil." This is one of eight panels depicting the human life cycle, so be sure to appreciate the entire story.

#### **Yomeimon Gate**

This is a symbol of Toshogu and a national treasure. Covered with over 500 intricate carvings, the gate is said to be so captivating you could gaze at it all day without getting tired, earning it the nickname **'Higurashi-no-mon (Twilight Gate)'**.

- **Secret**: Look for the 'Mayoke-no-hashira (Evil-repelling Pillar),' one of the pillars that was intentionally erected upside down. This reflects the wisdom that "perfection is fleeting," so it was deliberately left incomplete.

#### **Nemuri Neko (The Sleeping Cat)**

The national treasure, the 'Sleeping Cat,' is small but holds a profound meaning. Behind the cat, sparrows are carved. This symbolizes a **'peaceful world'** where the sparrows can play safely because their natural predator, the cat, is asleep.

#### **Okumiya (Ieyasu's Tomb)**

Past the cat carving and up 207 stone steps, you will find the **'Okumiya,'** where Ieyasu's remains are enshrined. Unlike the ornate lower levels, this area is filled with a solemn and sacred atmosphere, making it the ultimate power spot at Toshogu.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Capturing the Aura of Victory

The items available at Toshogu embody the powerful energy and symbols of Ieyasu.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin, featuring the weighty calligraphy of **'東照宮 (Toshogu)'** and the seal of the Tokugawa clan crest, the **'Three Hollyhock Leaves (Mitsuba Aoi),'** is an emblem of authority itself. The Goshuin from the 'Yakushido Hall,' which features a painting of a crying dragon, is also popular.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Charm (Kachimamori)**: Imbued with the energy of Ieyasu, who unified the realm, this charm signifies 'certain victory.' It's the perfect gift for students and business people.
- **Sleeping Cat Charm**: A cute charm for peace and wish fulfillment.
- **Cat Bell Charm**: The tinkling sound of the bell is said to ward off evil spirits and attract good fortune.
