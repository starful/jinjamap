Hello, this is the **JinjaMap** editor.

Today, we will guide you to **Kibitsu Shrine (吉備津神社)**, the true stage of the Japanese folktale 'Momotaro (The Peach Boy)' and a sacred site of national treasure status that represents Okayama Prefecture.

This is not just an old shrine. It is a place where the main hall, a national treasure built in the unique 'Kibitsu-zukuri' architectural style found only in Japan, and a magnificent 360-meter-long corridor create an overwhelming landscape. Above all, it is steeped in the breathtaking myth of a battle between a hero and an oni (demon), and even today, a mystical ritual of divining fortunes by the sound of a cauldron is performed.

Let's begin our pilgrimage to Kibitsu Shrine, a fascinating space where the boundary between myth and reality blurs.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Encountering the Heart of the Shrine

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神)】**

The central deity enshrined at Kibitsu Shrine is **Okibitsuhiko-no-mikoto (大吉備津彦命)**.

He is a legendary hero, the son of the 7th Emperor Korei and the uncle of Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto. As a great general dispatched to bring peace and stability to ancient Japan, he is particularly revered as the deity who pacified the Kibi region (present-day Okayama Prefecture).

His divine nature, stemming from his great deeds of pioneering the land and establishing order, is widely known as a deity of **national pacification, warding off evil (厄除け), longevity, and victory**. Today, many people visit to seek his blessing for success in crucial moments of life, such as passing exams, winning sports competitions, or achieving business prosperity.

Most importantly, he is believed to be the **real-life model for the famous Japanese folktale 'Momotaro (桃太郎)'**. His story extends beyond the realm of myth and is deeply rooted in Japanese culture.

#### **【Origins and History: The Showdown Between Hero and Oni】**

The history of Kibitsu Shrine is more than just a record of its construction; it is like a grand heroic epic. At its core lies the myth of a fierce battle between Okibitsuhiko-no-mikoto and an oni (demon) named 'Ura (温羅)'.

**The Ancient Kingdom of Kibi and the Foreign Giant, Ura**
In the ancient Kingdom of Kibi, a foreigner named 'Ura' came from Baekje across the sea. Ura, a giant standing 4 meters tall with red hair, built an iron fortress called 'Kinojo (鬼ノ城, Oni's Castle)' and terrorized the people by plundering the surrounding areas. Fearing him, people called him the 'Oni of Kibi'.

**The Hero's Arrival: Okibitsuhiko-no-mikoto's Campaign**
The Yamato court dispatched the great general Okibitsuhiko-no-mikoto to restore peace to the land. He set up camp on the mountain where Kibitsu Shrine now stands and began his fight to subdue Ura. After an archery duel, the Mikoto's arrow pierced Ura's left eye. Mortally wounded, Ura transformed into a pheasant and fled. The Mikoto turned into a hawk and gave chase. When Ura transformed again into a carp and leaped into a river, the Mikoto became a cormorant and finally captured him. Traces of this epic chase remain in the place names around the shrine.

**The Wailing Head and the Birth of a Mystical Ritual**
Ura's head, severed by the Mikoto's sword, continued to wail for years even after falling to the ground. The Mikoto buried his head deep beneath the shrine's 'Okamaden (御釜殿),' but the crying did not stop. One day, Ura appeared in the Mikoto's dream and proposed, "If you have my wife cook the offerings to the gods, I will foretell the world's fortunes through the sound of the cauldron."

This dream marked the beginning of the mystical Shinto ritual, the **'Narukama Shinji (鳴釜神事, The Ritual of the Ringing Cauldron)'**, which can only be seen at Kibitsu Shrine. This is not merely a legend; it is a sacred ceremony that continues to be performed to this day, divining people's fates.

### 2. Strolling the Grounds: Sights and Power Spots

The grounds of Kibitsu Shrine are the stage of a myth and a massive work of art in themselves.

#### **【National Treasure Main Hall (Honden) & Worship Hall (Haiden)】**

The main hall (Honden) and worship hall (Haiden), the center of worship, boast a unique presence in Japanese architectural history. These buildings were constructed in a one-of-a-kind style called **'Kibitsu-zukuri (吉備津造)'** and are designated as a **Japanese National Treasure**.

The most prominent feature is the **'Hiyoku Irimoya-zukuri (比翼入母屋造)'** roof, which has two large hip-and-gable roofs (irimoya-zukuri) joined side-by-side. The curve of the roof, resembling a giant bird spreading its wings, evokes a sense of awe beyond mere grandeur. Offer your prayers at the Haiden following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette, and feel the victorious energy that permeates this great space.

#### **【The Beautiful 360-meter-long Corridor (Kairō)】**

After praying at the main hall, your steps will naturally lead you to the long corridor extending to the south. This wooden corridor, stretching for a total of **360 meters**, was built following the natural topography without artificially leveling the ground. As you walk along the corridor, which undulates with gentle slopes, the sunlight and shadows filtering through the pillars create a fantastical scene. It is a perfect walking course and photo spot that shows different charms with each season, from cherry blossoms in spring and hydrangeas in summer to autumn foliage.

#### **【Hidden Gems & Power Spots】**

- **Okamaden (御釜殿) and Narukama Shinji (鳴釜神事)**
  Located at the end of the corridor, this is the mystical place where the head of the oni 'Ura' is said to be buried. Even today, the 'Narukama Shinji' ritual, which divines fortunes through a cauldron, is performed here. You can participate in the ritual by making a reservation in advance. The success of your wish is determined by the volume and duration of the "Goooo-" sound that emanates from the cauldron. It's a special power spot experience unique to Kibitsu Shrine.

- **Ichidōsha (一童社)**
  This is a shrine for praying for academic success and the growth of children. It enshrines a 'god of wisdom,' making it a popular spot for students and parents. Be sure to visit if you have an important exam or promotion coming up.

- **The Giant Ginkgo Tree (Goshinboku)**
  On the grounds stands a giant ginkgo tree over 600 years old. This tree, soaring towards the sky, is a living witness to the shrine's history. We hope you receive good energy from its overwhelming life force, which turns a brilliant golden color in the autumn.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Charms (Juyohin): A Token of Your Visit

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kibitsu Shrine embodies its history and dignity. In the center, the characters for **'Kibitsu-no-miya (吉備津宮)'** are written in powerful calligraphy, and the vermilion shrine seal is stamped with the 'Go-shichi no kiri (五七桐)' crest associated with the imperial family, adding to its nobility. During special periods, limited-edition goshuin with Momotaro legend motifs are also available.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Engimono (縁起物)】**

- **Momo-no-Omamori (桃のお守り, Peach Charm)**: As the birthplace of the Momotaro legend, this cute peach-shaped charm is the most popular. It is believed to ward off evil and bring good fortune.
- **Shōbu-mamori (勝負守, Victory Charm)**: This charm contains the blessing of Okibitsuhiko-no-mikoto, the god of victory. It is recommended for those facing important challenges in life, such as exams, job hunting, or sports competitions.
- **Yaoki-no-Moshio (矢置の桃塩)**: This purifying salt originates from the legend where the hero placed his arrows on a rock and prayed for victory. Placing it in your home is said to ward off negative energy.
