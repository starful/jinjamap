Hello, this is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' on a journey to discover hidden gems and sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to **'Shiogama Shrine (鹽竈神社)'**, the gateway to Matsushima, one of Japan's Three Great Views, and a historic sanctuary that has protected the sea and land of the Tohoku region for 1,200 years. This is a legendary land where a mystical old man, who taught the art of salt-making, is said to have resided.

As you climb the 202 steep stone steps, feeling the sea-breeze, a magnificent shrine appears, offering a panoramic view of the breathtaking Matsushima Bay. From the salt charm that promises **'everything will go well (umaku iku)'** to the mystical 'Shiogama-zakura' cherry blossoms, this place is full of wonders.

Let's embark on a journey to Shiogama Shrine, a place to cleanse your body and mind and fill yourself with new energy!

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: Peace Guided by the God of Salt

The origins of Shiogama Shrine are intertwined with the adventures of mythological heroes.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Guides Who Open the Way】**

Three deities are enshrined here.

- **Betsugu (Shiotsuchi-oji-no-kami)**: The main deity of this shrine, known as the **'God of Salt'** and the **'God of Guidance.'** He brought prosperity by teaching people salt-making techniques and is revered as a wise god who guides paths across the sea and through life. He grants blessings for **safe childbirth**, **traffic safety**, and **good fortune**.
- **Left and Right Palaces (Takemikazuchi & Futsunushi)**: Two warrior gods who pacified the country. They govern **luck in competitions**, **success**, and **warding off evil**.

#### **【Origins and History: A 1200-Year Guardian】**

According to myth, Shiotsuchi-oji-no-kami acted as a guide when the two warrior gods went to pacify the east (Tohoku). After completing their mission, the warrior gods returned, but the old god remained here and taught the people how to make salt by boiling seawater. The shrine 'Shiogama' (salt cauldron) was built to honor his grace.
During the Edo period, it received full support from the Date Masamune clan, attaining its current splendid and grand appearance. The main hall, designated as a National Important Cultural Property, is a masterpiece showcasing the finest craftsmanship of its time.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: 202 Steps and Mystical Cherry Blossoms

The path into the shrine grounds is a journey of discipline and healing in itself. Here are the must-see spots.

#### **Otoko-zaka (202 Stone Steps)**

These are the **202 steep stone steps** leading to the shrine's main gate. Although they will leave you breathless, it is said that one piece of misfortune falls away with each step you climb. The feeling of exhilaration upon passing through the **'Zuishinmon Gate'** at the top is indescribable. (For those who find it difficult, you can use the gentler 'Onna-zaka' slope!)

#### **Main Hall (National Important Cultural Property)**

The main hall boasts an overwhelming sense of dignity with its vermilion lacquer, gold leaf decorations, and unique roof structure. Make a wish as you pay your respects at the Betsugu and the Left and Right Palaces in order.

#### **Shiogama-zakura (Natural Monument)**

Within the shrine grounds, you can find the rare cherry blossom, **'Shiogama-zakura,'** which can only be seen here. Its spectacular appearance, with 30 to 50 overlapping petals, is truly a sight to behold. If you visit in late April to early May, be sure to see it.

#### **The Mystical Cauldrons (Okama Shrine)**

A short distance from the main shrine is the sub-shrine **'Okama Shrine,'** which houses the **'Four Divine Cauldrons'** said to have been used by the god in the myth to make salt. Legend has it that the water in the cauldrons never runs dry and its color changes when a calamity is about to befall the country. (This is considered one of Japan's Three Great Miracles!)

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: The Magic of Salt for Good Fortune

As a place dedicated to the god of salt, it is filled with items for purification and good luck.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Shiogama Shrine is powerful and elegant. Be sure to receive both the main shrine's goshuin, stamped with **'陸奥國一宮 (Mutsu-no-kuni Ichi-no-miya),'** and the goshuin from the Okama Shrine with its mystical cauldrons.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Shiomamori (Salt Charm for Smooth Success)**: The bestseller here! This charm combines a play on words, **"everything goes smoothly (umaku iku),"** with the purifying power of salt (shio). It's a powerful item to ward off evil and attract good fortune.
- **Safe Childbirth Charm**: Originating from the practice of making salt using the tides, it is believed to aid in safe childbirth.
