### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: A Connection Forged by Japan's First Divine Couple

The mystique of Kumano Taisha begins with the story of the deities enshrined here.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Izanagi and Izanami】**

The main deities (*shusaijin*) here are the creator couple who mark the beginning of Japanese mythology: **Izanagi-no-Mikoto** and **Izanami-no-Mikoto**.
They are the 'first couple' who created the Japanese archipelago from chaos and gave birth to numerous gods. Although they met a sad end in the myth, Kumano Taisha honors the moments when their love was strongest, establishing it as a place that blesses **'marital bonds'**, **'romantic relationships'**, and the **'birth of life'**.

#### **【Origins and History: 1,200 Years of Faith】**

Founded in 806 AD, Kumano Taisha served as the **'Ichinomiya (first-ranked shrine)'** of Dewa Province (modern-day Yamagata and Akita areas), making it the central spiritual site of the region since ancient times. Its prestige was so great that legendary warlords like Date Masamune and Uesugi Kenshin worshipped here, praying for military fortune and the prosperity of their domains. With such a long history, the shrine grounds are filled with national-treasure-class cultural assets, making a simple walk feel like a journey through time.

### 2. 🐇 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Finding the Rabbits of Happiness

You should walk through the grounds of Kumano Taisha with the excitement of a treasure hunt. Here are the key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Magnificent Thatched-Roof Haiden (Hall of Worship)**

At the end of the main path, the *haiden* (hall of worship) appears, covered with a grand thatched roof (*kayabuki*). The harmony of the moss-covered roof, which has weathered hundreds of years, and the wooden structure showcases the essence of traditional Japanese architecture. Offer your prayers here with sincerity, following the 'two bows, two claps, one bow' etiquette.

#### **★ Key Point: The 'Three Rabbits' Behind the Main Hall**

After praying, walk around to the back of the *haiden*. This is the highlight of Kumano Taisha. Hidden among the carvings under the eaves of the main hall (*honden*) are **three rabbits**.

- **The Legend**: "If you find all three rabbits, your wish will come true, and you will meet a good partner."
- **Hint**: You can find the first two relatively easily, but the third one is very well hidden. It is said that the blessing will be lost if you ask a priest or are told the location by someone else, so you must find it on your own!

#### **The 900-Year-Old Ginkgo Tree (Oicho)**

Near the entrance to the grounds stands a giant ginkgo tree over 900 years old. In autumn, it turns a brilliant gold, creating a spectacular sight. Take a deep breath under the tree and feel the energy of the earth.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: A Connection Forged by Moonlight

The amulets and souvenirs at Kumano Taisha are often romantic, themed around 'connections' and 'the moon'.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

In addition to the standard *goshuin*, a limited-edition *goshuin* from the **'Tsukimusubi (月結び)'** event, held on the night of the full moon each month, is very popular. Its dreamlike design featuring the moon and rabbits excites collectors.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Musubi (Knot) Charm**: An amulet made of red thread twisted into the shape of the character for 'tie' (結). Its simple yet striking design symbolizes the firm binding of a connection.
- **Rabbit Omikuji**: A paper fortune (*omikuji*) is tucked inside a cute ceramic rabbit figurine. You can choose between pink (for love) and white (for general fortune). It also makes a great decoration.
- **Kanae (Wish) Charm**: A small pouch charm where you can place a piece of paper with your wish written on it.
