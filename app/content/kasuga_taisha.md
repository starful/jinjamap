  Taisha'

Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to mystical sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a peaceful forest in Japan's ancient capital, Nara, where deer roam freely. This is the legendary land where, 1,300 years ago, a god descended on a white deer to ensure the nation's prosperity. It is **'Kasuga Taisha (春日大社),'** a UNESCO World Heritage site and a symbol of Nara.

The harmony of the vibrant vermilion shrine and moss-covered stone lanterns, with deer wandering among them, feels like a scene from a fantasy movie.
From the energy of a primeval forest that has existed for millennia and the magical world of light created by 3,000 lanterns, to a special shrine that grants wishes for love.

Shall we embark on a journey through time to Kasuga Taisha, an experience that goes beyond mere sightseeing to heal the soul?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The God Who Rode a White Deer

The mystique of Kasuga Taisha is special from its very beginning.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): A Powerful Ensemble】**

This is the head shrine of the 'Kasuga-no-kami,' enshrining a remarkable four deities.

- **Takemikazuchi**: The god of war who descended on a white deer. He is responsible for **national protection**, **victory**, and **warding off evil**.
- **Futsunushi**: The god of swords, who ensures **success** and **traffic safety**.
- **Amenokoyane**: The god of wisdom and words, who aids in **academic achievement** and **career advancement**.
- **Himegami**: The goddess who presides over love and peace, assisting with **marital harmony** and **matchmaking**.

With such powerful deities gathered here, Kasuga Taisha is known as an all-purpose power spot that can grant any of life's wishes.

#### **【Origins and History: Why Deer Are Considered Sacred】**

In 768, the Fujiwara clan needed a guardian deity for the capital city of Nara. They decided to invite the god Takemikazuchi from the distant 'Kashima Jingu' in Ibaraki Prefecture. It was then that the legend was born: the god descended to the summit of Mount Mikasa, riding a **white deer** through the clouds.

From that time on, Nara became the 'mountain where the gods dwell,' and the deer, as 'messengers of the gods,' received utmost protection. It is likely thanks to this millennium of belief that the deer in Nara Park today are not afraid of people and allow them to come close.

### 2. 🦌 A Stroll Through the Grounds: The Forest of Lanterns and the Shrine of Matchmaking

The shrine grounds are a magical space where simply walking around is a healing experience. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **The Path of Stone Lanterns and the Main Sanctuary**

Along both sides of the approach, over 2,000 moss-covered stone lanterns stretch endlessly. These were dedicated one by one by people of the past making wishes, eventually forming a forest of their own. At the end of the path, the vermilion Main Sanctuary and its corridors appear in perfect harmony with nature. The 1,000 bronze lanterns hanging in the corridors are particularly breathtaking.

#### **Fujinami-no-ya (Lantern Experience in the Dark)**

The highlight of Kasuga Taisha! This is a dark room where you can experience the magic of the **'Mantoro Festival,'** held only twice a year in February and August, all year round. The hundreds of flickering lights in the pitch-black darkness offer a dreamlike experience, as if you are floating through the cosmos. It's also a famous spot for taking unforgettable photos.

#### **Meoto Daikokusha Shrine**

This is the only shrine in Japan that enshrines a **married couple of deities**. The ema (votive plaques) here are shaped like pink hearts! It's a power spot overflowing with love, constantly visited by people praying for **marital bliss** and **success in love**. Don't forget to try the 'Mizu-ura Mikuji,' a water fortune-telling where you float a heart-shaped ema.

#### **Wakamiya Jūgo-sha Meguri (Pilgrimage of 15 Shrines)**

This is a pilgrimage course that takes you to 15 smaller shrines along a forest path near the main sanctuary. Meet various deities who grant different wishes for health, wisdom, and wealth, and soak up the pure energy of the forest.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Luck Delivered by Deer

Many of the items available at Kasuga Taisha are themed around cute deer, making them highly collectible.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The Goshuin features '春日大社' written in powerful calligraphy, stamped with the shrine's symbolic **'wisteria (fuji)'** crest. Limited edition Goshuin may also be available during special worship periods or the Mantoro Festival.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Deer Mikuji**: A cute wooden deer figurine holding a fortune slip in its mouth. It makes a great decoration and is the most popular souvenir. (There's a white deer version, too!)
- **Wisteria Charm**: Wisteria symbolizes life force and prosperity. It is for wishing for health and family prosperity.
- **Wish-Granting Charm (Kanae Mamori)**: A beautiful charm shaped like a cherry blossom petal, very popular among women.
