---

Hello, readers! This is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a very special place hidden amidst the forest of buildings in Akasaka (赤坂), the glamorous heart of Tokyo. It may look like an ordinary shrine from the outside, but the moment you step in, you are met with the overwhelming gaze of thousands of fox statues. This is the **'Toyokawa Inari Tokyo Betsuin (豊川稲荷東京別院)'**.

Did you know that this place is not actually a shrine, but a **temple (寺)**? Or that it was the secret place where the greatest magistrate of the Edo period, 'Ooka Echizen,' secretly prayed for his success? Our journey into the mystical forest guarded by a thousand foxes and the 'Yuzukin' that is said to clear the way for financial luck begins now.

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: The Guardian of Buddhism Riding a Fox

Toyokawa Inari Tokyo Betsuin is unique right from its identity.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Toyokawa Dakini-shinten】**

Because of the name 'Inari,' it's easy to assume it's a shrine dedicated to a fox god, but this is a branch temple of the Soto school of Zen Buddhism. The main deity here is **Toyokawa Dakini-shinten (豊川吒枳尼真天)**.
According to legend, Dakini-shinten, a guardian deity of Buddhism, appeared riding a white fox and holding a rice stalk. This led to a syncretism with the Shinto Inari faith, and it came to be called 'Toyokawa Inari.'
She is famous for bringing blessings of **business prosperity**, **household safety**, and above all, **powerful financial luck** and the ability to **sever bad relationships and forge good ones**.

#### **【Origin and History: The Secret to a Great Magistrate's Success】**

The history of this place is intertwined with the success story of the star magistrate of the Edo period, **Ooka Tadasuke**.
In his youth, he was a devout follower of the Toyokawa Inari (main temple) in his hometown of Aichi Prefecture. Even after moving to Edo, he enshrined Dakini-shinten in his own home and prayed daily. Subsequently, he rose through the ranks to a key position in the shogunate, achieving great success.
As rumors spread that "the Inari at Lord Ooka's residence is miraculous," he opened it up for common people to worship, which marked the beginning of this Tokyo Betsuin. In a way, one man's earnest faith created one of Tokyo's top power spots today.

### 2. 🦊 A Stroll Through the Grounds: A Labyrinth of Foxes and a Golden Aura

The grounds are filled with such a mystical atmosphere that it's hard to believe you're in the city center. Here are some points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Reikozuka (霊狐塚): The Gaze of a Thousand Foxes**

This is the highlight of the temple. It's a place densely packed with thousands of stone fox statues dedicated by people whose wishes were granted, as a sign of gratitude. Walking among the foxes, each with a red bib and a different expression and posture, you'll feel a sense of awe, as if you've entered another dimension. This is one of Tokyo's most powerful spiritual energy spots.

#### **Yuzu Inari (融通稲荷): The Secret to Financial Luck**

In front of 'Yuzu Inari,' a small shrine near the main hall, you'll find yellow envelopes piled up. Inside them is the **'Yuzukin' (a 10-yen coin)**. Legend has it that if you carry this in your wallet, "money will circulate without blockage." It is customary to return it a year later with gratitude, adding some 'interest'(?) to it. If you're wishing for financial luck, be sure to get one!

#### **Benzaiten and Money Washing (Zeniarai)**

By the pond on the grounds, there is a shrine dedicated to 'Benzaiten,' one of the Seven Lucky Gods. It is said that washing your money in the sacred water here will increase your wealth. Try carefully washing your bills or coins in the provided basket. The key is not to spend that money, but to keep it in your wallet as 'seed money'!

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Good Fortune with the Foxes

The talismans here are both humorous and carry powerful meanings.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

As it is a temple, the Goshuin is written in bold, powerful calligraphy reading **'奉拝 豊川吒枳尼真天 (Respectful worship, Toyokawa Dakini-shinten)'**. Stamps reading 'Toyokawa-kaku (豊川閣)' and a Siddham script (Sanskrit) character add to its sanctity.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Yuzukin Pouch**: A dedicated charm, this yellow silk pouch lets you carry your Yuzukin. A must-have item to boost your financial luck!
- **Inari Sushi Charm**: A cute charm shaped like inarizushi (sushi rice in a fried tofu pouch). It's very popular as a gift, symbolizing 'eating luck and filling up with fortune.'
- **Fox Traffic Safety Sticker**: With its hip and stylish design, this fox sticker is popular among young drivers.
