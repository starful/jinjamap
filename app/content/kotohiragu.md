  at Kotohira-gu'
---

Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I'll guide you to **'Kotohira-gu' (金刀比羅宮)**, a symbol of Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku and a revered sanctuary that the Japanese people dream of visiting at least once in their lifetime. Better known by its affectionate nickname **'Konpira-san,'** this is a place where a sea god is enshrined, serving as a steadfast guardian not only for safety on sea routes but also for the voyage of life itself.

However, a special rite of passage is required to meet this deity: climbing **785 stone steps**. (The journey to the inner shrine, Okusha, is a staggering 1,368 steps!) It's a climb that will leave you breathless, but with each step, worldly thoughts fade away, leaving only a clear mind—a mystical experience. And at the summit, you are rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view and the **'Yellow Amulet of Happiness.'**

Let's begin our pilgrimage to Kotohira-gu, a journey that offers rewards as valuable as the effort it takes.

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The God from Across the Sea and the Konpira Dog

Konpira-san has a unique history where Shinto gods and Buddhist figures coexisted.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Ōmononushi-no-Kami】**

The main deity (Shusaijin) here is **Ōmononushi-no-Kami**. Although a god of agriculture, medicine, and nation-building, he is especially venerated here as the deity of **'maritime safety.'**
The name 'Konpira' originally came from 'Kumbhira,' a Hindu crocodile deity from the Ganges River, which was introduced to Japan with Buddhism. Through Shinbutsu-shūgō (the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism), Kumbhira became identified with the god Ōmononushi. Thus, he holds a powerful force that protects not only sailors but also all those navigating the rough seas of life, ensuring their safety and success.

#### **【Origin and History: The Sacred Site Visited by a Dog on its Master's Behalf】**

During the Edo period, travel was difficult for commoners, but pilgrimages to Ise Grand Shrine and Kotohira-gu were permitted. However, those who couldn't make the journey due to illness or distance would send their pet dogs in their place with a special collar. The collar held a small wooden tag that read "On a pilgrimage to Konpira" and some money for travel expenses.
Fellow travelers would care for these dogs, calling them **'Konpira-ken' (Konpira dogs),** and the dogs would safely complete the pilgrimage and return with an amulet for their master. It's a touching story born from the warm hearts and deep faith of the people.

### 2. ⛰️ A Stroll Through the Grounds: Heavenly Scenery at the Top of the Stairs

The pilgrimage to Kotohira-gu is both an ascetic practice and a healing experience. Here are the must-see spots.

#### **Ōmon (Main Gate) & Konpira Dog Statue**

After climbing 365 steps, the magnificent main gate (Ōmon) appears. Passing through it marks the beginning of the sacred precincts. Inside the gate are five candy shops (Gonin Byakushō), the only ones historically permitted to do business within the shrine grounds. Nearby is the cute **'Konpira Dog Statue,'** so be sure to take a commemorative photo.

#### **Shinme (Sacred Horses)**

Past the main gate, you'll find the stable for the sacred horses the gods are said to ride. Two white horses, 'Luce' and 'Tsukishiro,' greet the pilgrims. If you're lucky, you might even see the Shinme taking a walk.

#### **Main Shrine (御本宮) and Observation Deck**

After conquering 785 steps, you finally arrive at the **Main Shrine (Gohongū)**. The view from 251 meters above sea level, looking out over the Sanuki Plain and the distant Seto Inland Sea, is truly liberating. As you offer your prayers in the cool breeze, all your fatigue will wash away. The Ema-den next to the main shrine is filled with paintings and models of ships, offered by sailors in gratitude for their safe return.

#### **Okusha (Izutama Shrine)**

If you have the energy, take on the challenge! Another 583 steps from the Main Shrine will lead you to **Okusha (Izutama Shrine)**, for a total of 1,368 steps. This tranquil shrine, nestled in a lush forest, exudes a sacred aura distinct from that of the main shrine. It's also fun to try and find the face of a Tengu (a mythical creature) carved into the cliff face.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Grasp Yellow Happiness

The talismans and souvenirs of Kotohira-gu are characterized by the color yellow, which symbolizes 'happiness.'

#### **【Yellow Amulet of Happiness】**

This is Konpira-san's signature item! It's a set of charms made of **vivid yellow cloth with the character '金' (gold) embroidered in gold thread.** (Includes a mini Konpira dog figurine). It is incredibly popular as it is said to grant all wishes for health, happiness, and financial fortune.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

You can receive a goshuin at both the Main Shrine and Okusha. The bold characters **'金刀比羅宮 (Kotohira-gu)'** and the red seal are like a medal of honor for those who have completed the arduous climb.

#### **【Konpira Dog Omikuji】**

These are fortune slips (omikuji) tucked inside a cute dog figurine. The golden dog is said to symbolize wealth, so why not adopt one?

### 4. 🍜 Nearby Attractions: Udon School and Kabuki Theater

After your shrine visit, enjoy the flavors and culture of Kagawa Prefecture.

#### **1. Nakano Udon School**

- **Location**: At the entrance of the shrine path.
- **Experience**: You're in 'Udon Prefecture,' so you have to try making udon! It's a fun experience where you knead dough with your feet to upbeat music, cut the noodles yourself, and then cook and eat them. You even get a diploma.

#### **2. Kanamaru-za (Former Konpira Grand Theatre)**

- **Location**: About a 10-minute walk from the shrine path.
- **Features**: This is the oldest existing Kabuki theater in Japan (an Important Cultural Property). You can tour the Edo-period stage mechanics and dressing rooms, and actual performances are held in the spring.

#### **3. Omotesandō Shopping Street**

- **What to enjoy**: Rest your tired legs from climbing the stairs. The **'Oiri Soft Cream'** (ice cream decorated with colorful roasted rice crackers) is sweet, pretty, and a must for your photo feed! The menchi-katsu (minced meat cutlet) and fried fish cakes are also delicious.
