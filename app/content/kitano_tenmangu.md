Hello, this is the editor of 'JinjaMap,' your guide to special sacred sites around the world.

Today, I will guide you to a place in the ancient capital of Kyoto, beloved by students and test-takers among its numerous temples and shrines. This is **'Kitano Tenmangu (北野天満宮)'**. It is the head shrine of over 12,000 Tenmangu shrines nationwide and a representative power spot for academic achievement in Kyoto.

The spirit of 'Sugawara no Michizane,' a genius scholar who was unjustly exiled and died but became a god after his death, is enshrined here. As you stroke the 'Nade-ushi,' the wish-granting ox statue, and immerse yourself in the fragrance of the plum blossoms he loved, your anxieties will fade, and your confidence for success will grow.

Shall we journey together to Kitano Tenmangu, a place filled with wisdom, success, and cultural fragrance?

### 1. 🙏 Deity and Origin: How a Tragic Genius Became the God of Learning

Behind the grandeur of Kitano Tenmangu lies the dramatic life and death of one man.

#### **【Enshrined Deity (御祭神): Sugawara no Michizane】**

The principal deity here is **Sugawara no Michizane**, the greatest intellectual and politician of the Heian period.
Called a child prodigy from a young age, he rose to the rank of Minister of the Right, but was unjustly exiled to Dazaifu in Kyushu due to the slander of a political rival, where he died a lonely death. After his death, a series of natural disasters struck Kyoto, and to appease his vengeful spirit, people began to worship him as **'Tenjin (天神, a heavenly deity)'**.

Over time, Tenjin, once an object of fear, came to be revered as the **'God of Learning'** and the **'God of Intellect'** thanks to his outstanding scholarship. Today, it has become a symbol of hope, attracting a constant stream of visitors praying for success in various exams, including school entrance exams, certifications, and employment.

#### **【Origin and History: A Faith Spanning a Millennium】**

Founded in 947, Kitano Tenmangu has stood for over a thousand years as a guardian of Kyoto and a hall of learning.
It was also the site of the legendary Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony hosted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and its main hall, designated a National Treasure, showcases the essence of magnificent Momoyama-style architecture. The shrine grounds are filled with 1,500 plum trees, which Michizane cherished in his lifetime, transforming it into Kyoto's premier plum blossom viewing spot every February.

### 2. 🐂 A Stroll Through the Precincts: Petting Oxen and Searching for Stars

The precincts are filled with symbols related to Lord Michizane. Here are some key points you shouldn't miss.

#### **Nade-ushi (Stroking Ox): A Symbol of Wisdom and Healing**

Throughout the grounds, you will find various ox statues called **'Nade-ushi'**. This is because Lord Michizane was born in the Year of the Ox, and legend says his grave was built on the spot where the ox pulling his funeral cart stopped.
It is said that **"if you touch the part of the ox corresponding to your own ailment, it will be healed,"** and **"rubbing the ox's head is believed to make you smarter."** As a result, the heads of the oxen are always polished smooth. Find your favorite ox and make a wish as you stroke it gently.

#### **The National Treasure Main Hall and Ishinoma**

The main hall and worship hall, both National Treasures, are connected by an **'Ishinoma (stone room)'** in the unique 'Gongen-zukuri' style. The brilliant gold leaf decorations and complex roof curves are overwhelming to behold. Offer a prayer for academic success in front of the worship hall with "two bows, two claps, and one bow."

#### **Sankomon (Three Lights Gate) and the Hidden Star**

The middle gate, **'Sankomon,'** is so named because it is said to have carvings of the sun, moon, and stars. However, if you look closely, you can find carvings of the sun and moon, but not the star. Legend has it that this is because the North Star shone directly above the gate, so there was no need to carve it. (However, some rumors say there is a hidden star somewhere, so try to find it!)

#### **Plum Grove and Maple Garden**

From early February to late March, you can enjoy the subtle fragrance of plum blossoms in the **'Plum Grove (Bai-en),'** which is open to the public for a fee. In the fall, the **'Maple Garden (Momiji-en)'** opens, offering a spectacular view of a tunnel of red maples and the red Uguisubashi Bridge.

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Talismans: Carrying the Charms of Success

As a sacred site for learning, the shrine is full of special items for students.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Kitano Tenmangu features powerful calligraphy and a plum blossom seal. Depending on the season, a plum or maple stamp may be added, and limited-edition goshuin related to treasure exhibitions, such as the sword 'Onikirimaru,' are also popular.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Kengaku Omamori (Academic Encouragement Charm)**: A charm meant to encourage diligence in studies. Perfect for attaching to a school bag.
- **Gōkaku (Success) Pencils**: These pentagonal (gokaku) pencils are a play on words with 'gōkaku' (合格, passing an exam) and are believed to bring good luck in the exam hall.
- **Geijōtatsu (Artistic Improvement) Charm**: A charm for those wishing to improve their skills in calligraphy or other arts.
