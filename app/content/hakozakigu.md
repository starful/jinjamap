  of ''Surrender of the Enemy Nation'' at Hakozakigu Shrine'
---

Hello, readers! This is your editor from 'JinjaMap,' here to add depth to your travels.

Today, I will guide you to a magnificent historical site hidden within the city, just a 10-minute subway ride from Fukuoka's Hakata Station. This is one of Japan's Three Great Hachiman Shrines, **'Hakozakigu Shrine (筥崎宮)'**.

This place is the origin of the legendary 'Kamikaze' (divine wind) that is said to have saved Japan from the invasion of the great Mongol Empire 700 years ago, and it is a **'holy land of victory'** where the SoftBank Hawks baseball team prays for championship victory every year. From the striking plaque reading 'Surrender of the Enemy Nation' on the national treasure-class Romon gate, to the pigeon fortunes that bring victory.

If you wish to receive a powerful aura that knows no defeat, shall we head to Hakozakigu Shrine together right now?

### 1. 🙏 Deities and Origins: The Miraculous Wind that Saved the Nation

The prestige of Hakozakigu Shrine comes from its historical background.

#### **【Enshrined Deities (御祭神): Hachiman Okami】**

The main deity here is **Emperor Ojin (Hachiman-shin)**. As the god of martial arts and victory, he has been revered by warriors since ancient times. Also enshrined are **Empress Jingu** (Emperor Ojin's mother) and **Tamayorihime**, who oversee safe childbirth and maritime safety, respectively.

#### **【Origins and History: Where the Divine Wind Blew】**

The highlight of Hakozakigu Shrine's history is the 'Mongol invasions (Yuan-Goryeo allied forces)' incident during the Kamakura period.
In 1274, when the Mongol army descended upon the seas off Kyushu, the imperial court prayed fervently here for the enemy's repulsion. A massive typhoon then arose, devastating the Mongol fleet. People called this a wind sent by the gods, the **'Kamikaze' (divine wind)**. With this miracle, Hakozakigu Shrine was established as the most powerful shrine protecting the nation.

### 2. 🏯 A Stroll Through the Grounds: Feeling the Weight of History

Upon entering the shrine grounds, you are greeted by architectural structures of overwhelming scale.

#### **Romon Gate and the 'Tekkoku Kofuku' Tablet**

The two-story Romon gate, a symbol of the shrine, is a National Important Cultural Property. However, what draws even more attention is the plaque hanging above it: **'Tekkoku Kofuku (敵国降伏)'**. This doesn't mean "to subjugate the enemy by force," but rather carries the profound meaning of "achieving peace by having the enemy surrender of their own accord through virtue (徳)." Feel the weight of history standing before these four powerful characters.

#### **Main Hall (Honden) and Worship Hall (Haiden)**

Rebuilt in 1546, the Main Hall and Worship Hall are masterpieces of the grand 'nagare-zukuri' architectural style. Offer a devout prayer here with the 'nirei nihakushu ichirei' (two bows, two claps, one bow) etiquette at this designated Important Cultural Property.

#### **Power Spots: The Gushing Stone and Sacred Pine**

- **Yushuseki (Gushing Stone)**: This is a mysterious stone next to the main hall. It is said that touching it will make your luck "gush forth," so be sure to touch it and receive its energy.
- **Hakomatsu (Sacred Pine)**: A legendary pine tree said to have been planted over the buried placenta of Emperor Ojin. This is the origin of the shrine's name, 'Hakozaki.'

### 3. 📜 Goshuin and Amulets: Seize Victory

Befitting the 'God of Victory,' the items offered here are also filled with a powerful aura.

#### **【Goshuin (御朱印)】**

The goshuin of Hakozakigu Shrine is a masterpiece of thick, powerful calligraphy. The goshuin, stamped with the characters **'筥崎宮 (Hakozakigu)'** and the shrine's seal, feels like a victory charm in itself.

#### **【Omamori (お守り) & Goods】**

- **Victory Amulet (Kachi-mamori)**: The bestseller here! This amulet, inscribed with the character **'勝' (victory)**, is a must-have item for athletes and students preparing for exams. The SoftBank Hawks players are also said to carry this amulet into their games.
- **Evil-warding Amulet**: Recommended for those who wish to ward off bad energy.
- **Pigeon Omikuji**: A cute fortune slip in the shape of a pigeon, the messenger of the god Hachiman. It also makes for a great decoration.
